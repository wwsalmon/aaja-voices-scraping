0,Benjamin Bradlee,executive editor,The Washington Post,"[1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979]",,"(Courtesy of The New York Times)Ben Bradlee’s Charmed, Charming LifeBy David CarrOctober 22, 2014Civilians, people who don’t think the toppling of a sitting American president with newspaper articles is one of humankind’s lasting achievements, will read encomiums to Ben Bradlee like this one and wonder: What’s the big deal?After all, he didn’t cover the Watergate story for his Washington Post, he picked the reporters. It’s not as if he wrote the articles, he edited them. But journalists are people who will go where they are pointed, and Mr. Bradlee generally pointed to important, consequential subjects. People who worked for him went through walls to bring back those stories, some of which revealed the true course of American history and some of which altered it.The newspaper business can be a grand endeavor, but most of the people who commit journalism would never be mistaken for larger than life. Journalists are bystanders who chronicle the exploits of people who actually do things.But Ben Bradlee did things. He went to war, loved early and often, befriended and took on presidents, swore like a sailor, and partied like a movie star. Now that he is gone — he died on Tuesday at the age of 93 at his home in Georgetown — it is tough to imagine a newspaperman ever playing the kind of outsize role that he once did in Washington. Newspapers, and people’s regard for them, have shrunk since he ran The Post.He took over an also-ran paper and turned it into a formidable fighting ship like the one on which he served in World War II. Once the newspaper he oversaw gained steam, there was only the relentless effort to beat the competition, to find and woo talent, to pursue targets that The Post deemed worthy.In the more than quarter-century that he helped lead the newsroom, from 1965 to 1991, he doubled its staff and circulation, and multiplied its ambitions. He would have been a terrible newspaperman in the current context — buyouts, reduced print schedules, timidity about offending advertisers — but he was a perfect one for his time.“I had a good seat,” he told The American Journalism Review in a 1995 interview. “I came along at the right time with the right job and I didn’t screw it up.”Mr. Bradlee had the attention span of a gnat — anecdotes of him walking away from a conversation he ceased to find interesting were common — but he was completely hypnotized by the chase of a good story.His own life and persona make for a pretty fair tale: Boston Brahmin, junior naval officer in World War II, Paris in the ’50s, friend of the Kennedys, tormentor of Nixon. He was Zelig-like in his ability to appear at critical junctures in American history.I knew him in the mid-’90s, when he was vice president at large of The Post, but he was still large, still engaged, perpetually on the hunt for political gossip or newsroom intrigue. He was a decent, if relentlessly loyal, source when I covered The Post as the editor of the Washington City Paper. But even though I barely knew him, he was hilarious to bump into.“I like your paper a lot,” he’d deadpan, “whenever it doesn’t have its,” insert sailor adjective, “finger in my eye.” Cue big roar of laughter, dancing eyes, deep pleasure at his own riposte.Anybody who has ever watched Mr. Bradlee enter a room knows that whatever “it” is, he had a lot of it. There was the smile, a flash of white teeth matching the white collar of the custom striped shirts he wore without fail, and a voice that was a mix of gravel and gravitas that had a hearty (and generally profane) word for everybody. In a town notorious for big entrances — Bill Clinton, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, you name it — Mr. Bradlee tilted a room just by being himself.“He was one of those people who could make you feel like a superstar just by being in the same room with him,” David Von Drehle, a longtime Post writer now at Time, told me by phone on Tuesday. “Every woman in the room wanted to be with him, and every man in the room wanted to be him.”He was a durable celebrity in Washington and beyond, partly because he was the rare person who became more handsome as he grew older. A photo from just two years ago that ran with a Post piece shows a remarkably good-looking 90-plus-year-old, a patrician pirate. Few journalists could suggest that they were better looking than the movie stars who played them, as Jason Robards portrayed Mr. Bradlee in the film about Watergate, “All the President’s Men,” but Mr. Bradlee could have claimed as much. He was more Clark Gable than Clark Kent.By some estimations, including his own, his most enduring accomplishment had nothing to do with the Pentagon Papers or Watergate. After he became editor of The Post, he watched with envy as The New York Herald Tribune and magazines like Esquire and Playboy were using a different vocabulary, a so-called New Journalism, to expand the ways in which stories were told.So in 1969, he conjured Style, a hip, cheeky section of the newspaper that reflected the tumult of the times in a city where fashion and discourse were rived with a maddening sameness. The effect on the business was profound, as if Chuck Berry had walked into a Glenn Miller show and started playing guitar. He expanded the vernacular of newspapering, enabling real, actual writers to shed the shackles of convention and generate daily discourse that made people laugh, spill their coffee or throw The Post down in disgust.He had nothing of the commoner about him, hosting and grilling much of the world’s elite at the Georgetown home he shared with Sally Quinn, a Post society reporter who became his third wife. But although he grew up in Boston, not even knowing anyone who was black, he managed to make a credible newspaper in a majority-black city. His efforts to cover the black community in deeper ways, combined with an overeager desire to believe in an unbelievable story, led to a Pulitzer Prize being returned in the Janet Cooke affair, a big blemish on a very shiny run.Mr. Bradlee could be almost cartoonishly ambitious. Asked by Katharine Graham, The Post’s publisher, about his interest in the top job at the paper, he immediately replied that he would “give my left one” for the opportunity. He probably would have gotten along fine on the remaining testosterone.A player of favorites and an admirer of bravado, he famously vetoed the hiring of a reporter who had already been vetted and all but hired, because “nothing clanks when he walks.”Ben Bradlee clanked when he walked.\*\*\*The executive editor of The Post from 1965 to 1991, Bradlee oversaw the Post's prize-winning coverage of the Watergate affair. He came to journalism via Harvard, did a stint working for the State Department in Paris, before becoming a reporter and editor at Newsweek and The Post. In 1971, he defied the Nixon administration by publishing the Pentagon Papers, a top-secret study of the Vietnam War and endured harsh criticism from Republicans during the early days of the Watergate scandal. Vindicated by Nixon's resignation, Bradlee was lionized in the movie version of ""All the President's Men,"" where he was portrayed by Jason Robards. In retirement he published a memoir, ""A Good Life."" -- from washingtonpost.com 7/18/2014 Benjamin Bradlee joined the Pulitzer Board in 1969."
1,Wallace Caroll,editor and publisher,Winston (N.C.) Journal,"[1972, 1973]",,"Wallace Carroll, Publisher And Editor, Is Dead at 95Wallace Carroll, a retired newspaper editor and publisher who campaigned against the Vietnam War and led his paper to a Pulitzer Prize for environmental reporting, died on Sunday in a nursing home in Winston-Salem, N.C. He was 95.Mr. Carroll had first joined The Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel in 1949 as executive editor but left in 1955 to serve eight years as news editor of the Washington bureau of The New York Times. He returned to Winston-Salem as editor and publisher from 1963 to 1973. Under his direction, the paper favored gun control and busing to integrate public schools, positions unpopular with many North Carolinians.Articles about environmental protection -- particularly a series on strip mining -- earned the paper the 1971 Pulitzer Prize for public service.On March 17, 1968, he published a signed editorial in Winston-Salem under the headline ''Vietnam -- Quo Vadis?'' that argued that United States policy in Southeast Asia was misguided and irrelevant to the goal of thwarting Soviet expansion. Dean Acheson, the former secretary of state and an adviser to President Lyndon B. Johnson, showed the editorial to Johnson and stood by while the president read it. Later that month, Johnson announced that he would not run for re-election and would begin peace negotiations with North Vietnam. In an article about events leading to Johnson's announcement, The Washington Post reported that Mr. Carroll's editorial had influenced his thinking.Two years later, Mr. Carroll wrote in another article: ''What we are losing is something more serious than the loss of any war or territory. It is the soul of America that is being lost in Vietnam. It is time for us to save the soul of America.''Wallace Carroll was born in Milwaukee on Dec. 15, 1906, and graduated from Marquette University. He began his journalism career as a reporter with The United Press in Chicago, and the news agency sent him to Europe to cover the Nazi advances. After the United States entered the war, Mr. Carroll became director of the United States Office of War Information in London. He was friendly there with James Reston, then a war correspondent in London for The Times. Mr. Reston wrote in his memoirs, ''Deadline,'' that Mr. Carroll emphasized ''with his usual common sense'' the importance of explaining United States policy to Americans and people in the allied countries but was often rebuffed by his superiors.After the war, he wrote a book about his work, ''Persuade or Perish,'' and became executive editor in Winston-Salem. Mr. Carroll maintained his friendship with Mr. Reston, and in 1955, Mr. Reston, as Washington bureau chief of The Times, hired Mr. Carroll to be his deputy with the title of news editor. Mr. Carroll was in charge of day-to-day coverage.In his history of The New York Times, ''The Kingdom and the Power,'' Gay Talese wrote that James Reston offered to make Mr. Carroll bureau chief if he would stay at The Times. But Mr. Carroll declined the offer and in 1963, he returned to Winston-Salem to be editor and publisher.Mr. Carroll's wife, Margaret, died last year. He is survived by a son, John S. Carroll, the editor of The Los Angeles Times, as well as by three daughters, Margaret Carroll of Washington, Rosamond Carroll of Kenfield, Calif., and Patricia Carroll of Arlington, Va.; four grandchildren and two great grandchildren.After he retired in 1973, Mr. Carroll lectured for several years at Wake Forest University. Although Mr. Carroll spent most of his career as a news executive, Reston wrote that he had ''a studied respect for the English language'' and ''could have edited Lincoln's Gettysburg Address and improved it.''-- (New York Times, July 30, 2002 by David E. Rosenbaum)Mr. Carroll Joined the Pulitzer Prize Board in 1969."
2,John Cowles,editorial chairman,The Minneapolis Star & Tribune,"[1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979]",,"John Cowles Jr., 82, Dies; Led Minneapolis Newspapersby Bruce Weber, March 19, 2012, The New York TimesJohn Cowles Jr., a Minneapolis newspaper executive and philanthropist whose support for arts, sports and entertainment helped elevate the Twin Cities' cultural community to national prominence, died on Saturday at home in Minneapolis. He was 82.The cause was lung cancer, his son Jay said.Scion of a family that owned The Des Moines Register, started Look magazine and came to dominate the newspaper business in Minneapolis for more than half a century, Mr. Cowles (rhymes with bowls) succeeded his father in 1961 as the editor of two Minneapolis papers, the morning Tribune and the evening Star. He became president and chief executive of The Minneapolis Star and Tribune Company (later renamed Cowles Media Company) in 1968.His tenure was rocky, but during it the papers won praise for aggressive local reporting, increased arts and science coverage and support for the civil rights movement and the Equal Rights Amendment in editorials. (Though he was generally described as a progressive liberal, Mr. Cowles served on a White House committee in 1965 to generate support for President Johnson's war policies.)The company's fortunes declined in the late 1960s, however, after several unsuccessful acquisitions, including Harper's magazine and the publisher Harper & Row. In 1979, The Star and Tribune Company bought The Buffalo Courier-Express but was forced to close it three years later.In 1982, the company merged The Star and The Tribune and cut its work force, prompting the editor of the merged papers to quit in protest. Mr. Cowles subsequently fired the publisher and assumed the role himself. But just a few months later, in early 1983, the board of Cowles Media, which included his sister and two cousins, dismissed him as publisher and head of the company as well.He remained on the board until 1984 and into the 1990s continued to control a substantial percentage of company stock through his management of a family trust. Cowles Media was sold to the McClatchy Company in 1998.Beyond his turbulent stewardship of the newspapers, Mr. Cowles was known in Minneapolis and St. Paul for his philanthropy and his belief that arts institutions and sports teams were necessary for cities to grow and thrive. In 1960, he served on a steering committee -- and by most accounts was its leading voice -- that persuaded the British director Tyrone Guthrie to establish a resident theater company in Minneapolis to perform classic works in repertory. He then helped raise $2.2 million, and the Guthrie Theater opened in 1963 with a production of ""Hamlet."" It became a model for nonprofit theaters across the country. Four decades later, he was co-chairman of the architecture committee for the new Guthrie Theater that opened in 2006.In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Mr. Cowles was active in the construction of the Metrodome, a state-financed domed stadium in downtown Minneapolis for the city's two major sports franchises, the Minnesota Twins and the Minnesota Vikings.His position on the project was controversial. Opponents, including staff members at The Minneapolis Tribune, thought it was a clear conflict of interest for the owner of a newspaper to take a public position on an important local issue it was covering. In 1979, staff members placed an ad in their own paper disassociating themselves from the company's involvement.The Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome opened in 1982; the Twins have since moved to Target Field.Mr. Cowles said in a 2010 interview that the impetus for his support of the Guthrie and the Metrodome were the same.""Strengthening the cultural organization and life of the Twin Cities was not only going to make life more interesting and attractive for our families,""  he said, ""but was going to attract business and keep business here in town, and it was going to be just plain good business.""Mr. Cowles was born on May 27, 1929, in Des Moines, Iowa, where his grandfather, Gardner Cowles, had been publisher of The Des Moines Register since 1903. His father, John, and his uncle Gardner Cowles Jr., known as Mike, founded Look magazine. John Cowles Sr. bought The Minneapolis Star in 1935 and moved his family to Minneapolis in 1938.The next year, the family business bought The Minneapolis Journal and merged it with The Star, and then added The Minneapolis Tribune in 1941. Young John graduated from the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and Harvard, and spent two years in the Army before joining the family business as a reporter.After his dismissal from the company in 1983, Mr. Cowles began a somewhat eclectic career. He studied agricultural economics, taught aerobics, toured in the United States and Europe with a modern dance company, and helped establish a women's professional fast-pitch softball league. He also continued his arts philanthropy around the Twin Cities; most recently, the Cowles Center, a theater devoted to dance, opened in Minneapolis last fall.Besides his son John III, known as Jay, Mr. Cowles is survived by his wife, the former Jane Sage Fuller, who is known as Sage Fuller Cowles and whom he married in 1952; another son, Charles; a daughter, Jane Sage Cowles; a stepdaughter, Tessa Flores; a sister, Sarah Cowles Doering; a brother, Russell; 10 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren."
3,Price Day,editor-in-chief,The Baltimore Sun,"[1972, 1973, 1974, 1975]",,"A native of Plainview, TX, Price Day (1907-1978) was graduated from Princeton University in 1928. Following a variegated career as a freelance cartoonist and writer of science fiction & children's stories (most notably the young adult novel Well, About the Penguin [Simon & Schuster, 1939]) and journeyman reporter with the Fort Lauderdale News, he briefly served as city editor of the Fort Lauderdale Times in 1942. Thereafter, he held a variety of positions with The Baltimore Sun, including evening edition rewriteman (1942), war correspondent (1943-45) and foreign correspondent (1945-60). He was the only individual newspaper affiliate present for the signing of the initial draft of the German Instrument of Surrender at Reims; in the latter capacity, he covered such epochal events as the Potsdam Conference and the Nuremberg trials. In 1949, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for a series on life in post-independence India that included the final newspaper interview with Mahatma Gandhi. This led to several series on the geopolitical vicissitudes of the British Commonwealth that were issued as short books by the Sun, including Crisis in South Africa (1948).In 1960, Day was appointed editor-in-chief of the Sun. He would ultimately serve in this capacity for fifteen years, a period that overlapped with his Pulitzer Advisory Board appointment from 1971-1975. While on the Board, Day served as a tireless advocate for international reportage and Asian correspondence in particular. Following his many peregrinations around the world, Day came full circle by retiring to the Plainview area, where he died on December 1, 1978. Although his eminent journalistic career ultimately eclipsed his earlier efforts, Day continued to write fiction throughout his life. A 1958 short story (""Four O'Clock"") was adapted by Rod Serling into a 1962 Twilight Zone episode (regarded as one of the ""creepiest"" in Serling's oeuvre) starring Theodore Bikel and Phyllis Love. Perhaps as a direct consequence of this exposure, the original story is frequently assigned in middle school curricula to this day.--Sean Murphy"

He graduated from the University of Kansas in 1929. After working for the Kansas City Star, he went to the United Press as a reporter from 1930-1948. While with UPI he served as a war correspondent in London from 1941-1944 and in Australia and Japan from 1944-1947. He married Joan Younger in 1949, and the two relocated to Philadelphia where he joined the Philadelphia Bulletin as an editor-a position he would hold until his retirement in 1973. He continued to write and report until his death in 1978."
5,Robert J. Donovan,associate editor,Los Angeles Times,"[1972, 1973, 1974, 1975]",,"(Courtesy of The New York Times)Robert J. Donovan, 90, the Author of 'PT-109'By Anthony RamirezAugust 10, 2003Robert J. Donovan, a ''shoe leather'' newspaper reporter without a college education who became a Washington correspondent, best-selling author and presidential historian, died on Friday at Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg, Fla. A longtime resident of Washington, he moved to Florida in 2001. He was 90.Best known for ''PT-109'' (McGraw-Hill, 1961), his stirring account of John F. Kennedy's war experiences, Mr. Donovan traveled 30,000 miles while doing research for the book and brought back a piece of coral from the South Pacific, which Kennedy kept on his desk after he became president. Mr. Donovan interviewed all 10 natives of the Solomon Islands involved in rescuing Kennedy and his crew after a Japanese destroyer sank their patrol torpedo boat in 1943. A 1963 movie based on the book starred Cliff Robertson as Kennedy.Mr. Donovan wrote 14 books, many about Washington politics, and was instrumental in the revival of Harry S. Truman's flagging reputation with a two-volume biography, ''Conflict and Crisis: The Presidency of Harry S. Truman, 1945-48'' (Norton, 1977) and ''Tumultuous Years: The Presidency of Harry S. Truman, 1949-53'' (Norton, 1982).Born in Buffalo in 1912, Mr. Donovan began his career in journalism at The Courier-Express there, earning $6 a week as a copy boy. He could not afford college in the Depression years, a career-killing drawback, it would seem, for the big-time newspaper Mr. Donovan had his heart set on, The New York Herald Tribune. But Mr. Donovan got to know an editor who was tired of hiring Yale University graduates. ''When I told him I hadn't been to college, a light came into his eyes,'' Mr. Donovan once told an interviewer.A 26-year career with The Herald Tribune followed. He became its Washington bureau chief in 1957. The consummate insider, he could nonetheless needle Washington officials.His journalism career was interrupted by World War II, when against the strenuous advice of a colleague at The Courier-Express, Mr. Donovan submitted to being drafted by the Army, though he had a young wife, Martha Fisher, and a small daughter, Patricia. Mr. Donovan survived the Battle of the Bulge, he noted in a laconic retelling, but the colleague did not survive the war. He died in 1945 when a B-25 bomber hit the Empire State Building.The Chandler family, intent on strengthening the journalism reputation of The Los Angeles Times, which it controlled, wooed Mr. Donovan from The Herald Tribune and made him the newspaper's Washington bureau chief in 1963. He narrowly missed becoming the top editor of the paper in 1970. According to ''The Life and Times of Los Angeles,'' (Atheneum, 1984) by Marshall Berges, Mr. Donovan was puzzled by the newspaper's culture, where editorial meetings were conducted in ''elliptical code.'' Otis Chandler, the publisher, got wind of Mr. Donovan's candid self-assessment to colleagues: ''I shouldn't be editor of this paper; I don't know what they're talking about.''Mr. Donovan is survived by his second wife, Gerry Van Der Heuvel, whom he married in 1978, and his stepchildren, Claudia, of Amherst, Mass., and Heidi, of Ottawa, Kan. His first wife, Martha Fisher, died in 1974. Their children, who also survive, are Patricia, Amy, and Peter Donovan, all of Washington. "

7,John Hohenberg,"executive secretary, The Pulitzer Prizes",Columbia University,"[1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976]",,"(Courtesy of The New York Times)John Hohenberg, 94, Former Pulitzer Prize Official, DiesBy Douglas MartinAugust 8, 2000John Hohenberg, who began his journalism career as a teenager by snatching an interview with the president of the United States and went on to become administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes, died Sunday morning at his home in Knoxville, Tenn. He was 94.Mr. Hohenberg also taught journalism for many years at Columbia University and wrote a widely used textbook on reporting. In all, he wrote 22 books -- including a novel at the age of 80 -- and maintained an arduous professional itinerary.He wrote for numerous New York newspapers and taught at universities from New York to Tennessee to Florida to Kansas to Syracuse. He traveled the world, particularly Asia, lecturing for the State Department and other federal agencies. He began the practice of publishing the names of Pulitzer jurors and of drawing jurors from regions beyond New York.Mr. Hohenberg came from the golden age of competitive newspapering, covering the 1935 trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann -- who was convicted of kidnapping Charles Lindbergh's baby -- hanging out with Hemingway in Paris and reporting on the birth pangs of the United Nations and Israel. Tom Goldstein, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University, speaks of ''the John Hohenberg legend.''Mr. Hohenberg's larger mission was elevating journalism itself, and he viewed the painstaking selection of Pulitzer winners as another means of raising the bar.''Our news media, our reporters and editors -- if they are serious people and if they really mean business and aren't merely sensation-minded -- should be the conscience of the American people,'' he said in a 1988 interview in The New York Times.He abhorred pomposity and wordiness, regarding journalism as a spontaneous ballet that could seldom be perfect because of daily deadlines. His motto, first growled to him by a crusty editor, was, ''Go with what you got.'' Generations of journalism students at Columbia committed the slogan to memory and the class of '69 had it printed on sweatshirts.Mr. Hohenberg was born on Feb. 17, 1906, in a tenement on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the son of Louis Hohenberg, a Hungarian immigrant, and Jettchen Scheuermann, an immigrant from Germany. When he was 18 months old, the family moved to Seattle, where his father set up several small businesses.He started as an engineering student at the University of Washington but did not like it. His father refused to pay for the liberal arts education he wanted, so the gangling 17-year-old showed up at The Seattle Star, now closed, to ask for a job.The response was brusque, he later recalled. ''Listen, kid,'' the city editor said, ''the president of the United States is coming to Seattle tomorrow. You get me an exclusive interview and I'll give you a job.''When the Secret Service demanded to see his nonexistent press credentials, employment seemed unlikely. He called the office, fearing that his name would mean nothing.''Mercifully,'' he wrote later, ''by grace of the kindly Jehovah that watches over babies, pretty girls and addled young men, the city editor remembered me and was sportsman enough to clear me for passage to the pier as a Star reporter.''The result was a second's conversation in which President Warren G. Harding allowed that he liked Seattle. Mr. Hohenberg turned the remark into a three-page story. ''For better or worse, I had become a newspaperman,'' Mr. Hohenberg said.The family soon moved back to New York to be nearer relatives. While attending journalism school at Columbia, Mr. Hohenberg worked for The New York Graphic, his first stop in 25 years of working for New York papers. After graduating, he toured Europe as the recipient of a Pulitzer Traveling Scholarship.In 1948, as he was reporting on the establishment of the United Nations at Lake Success, N.Y., he was asked to substitute for a Columbia journalism teacher who had broken a leg. The students liked him, he liked the students and a new career began.In 1960, he published what became the basic reporting and writing textbook used at many journalism schools, ''The Professional Journalist'' (Holt, Rinehart & Winston), which went through five editions and has been translated into Chinese, Japanese, Arabic and Spanish.His 21 other books ranged from several histories of the Pulitzer Prize to an exhaustive history of foreign correspondence, recounting its beginnings in the Napoleonic Wars and offering long analyses of the challenges facing journalism.Soon after his appointment in 1953 as administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes and secretary of the Advisory Board on Pulitzer Prizes, he nudged at least two members of the Pulitzer board into seeing all the plays under consideration for the drama prize, something not necessarily done before.In later years, he wrote about how the Columbia trustees, as final arbiters, refused to accept the Pulitzer board's recommendation that The New York Times be given a prize in 1972 for its publication of stories based on the Pentagon Papers, the government's classified history of the Vietnam War.The trustees were uneasy over the newspaper's decision to report classified material, an unusual action for journalists in that period. Columbia's president, William J. McGill, persuaded the trustees to reverse their decision.Then, Mr. McGill and Mr. Hohenberg persuaded the trustees to yield veto power over the Pulitzers, perhaps the biggest procedural change during Mr. Hohenberg's tenure, which ended in 1975. The year before, he had accepted an appointment as professor of journalism at the University of Tennessee. That was the first of a chain of academic stops over the last two decades of his life.Mr. Hohenberg married Dorothy Lannier, a classmate at Columbia, in 1928. She died in 1977. They had no children. He is survived by his second wife, JoAnn Fogarty Johnson, and her two children, whom he adopted: Pamela Green of Knoxville and Eric of Dawsonville, Ga.In 1986, Mr. Hohenberg's wife found a yellowing manuscript on newspaper copy paper in the basement that turned out to be the skeleton of a spy novel he had abandoned in the 1920's. He whipped it into shape and sold it, under the title ''The Parisian Girl.''In 1976 he received a Pulitzer Prize special award for his service to journalism. The citation said thousands of journalists had learned to value his tough integrity.''From you they learned to respect the language,'' it read. ''They might split an infinitive because you taught them how. But they dare not dangle a participle. You forbid it.'' "
8,William J. McGill,president,Columbia University,"[1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980]",,"William J. McGill, distinguished psychologist, author and president of Columbia University during the decade of the 1970s, died Sunday, Oct. 19, in La Jolla, Calif. He was 75 years old. He had suffered a severe heart attack last Wednesday and was a patient in John M. and Sally B. Thornton Hospital of the University of California, San Diego. He had been chancellor of UCSD from 1968 to 1970, before joining Columbia, and had been an adjunct professor there again for the past 17 years. Dr. McGill was a leading mathematical psychologist, highly regarded as both a theoretician and experimentalist. He made lasting research contributions in quantitative psychology, particularly in information processing, among them the precise measurement of reaction times to stimuli.At the time of his death, he had nearly completed a book with a former Columbia colleague on how the brain processes sound and light to expand the range of human perception.But it was Dr. McGill's skill in handling conflict that brought him public attention as chancellor of UCSD and recommended him for the Columbia presidency at the turbulent start of the 1970s. He calmed the San Diego campus when student demonstrations occurred and a controversial appointment was criticized. At Columbia, he began his decade-long term by dealing with student unrest face-to-face, at times plunging into crowds of anti-war and civil rights protesters to talk with their leaders.His legacy at both Columbia and San Diego includes heightened curricular and scholarly attention to human rights issues. ""Dr. McGill made an invaluable contribution to Columbia during a crucial decade in its history,""The University's current president, George Rupp, said. ""He continued to be a great friend of Columbia, and he will be missed tremendously both here in New York and in California.""""Bill McGill was one of the great figures in higher education in the period following World War II,"" said University of California President Richard C. Atkinson. ""He was a superb scientist, distinguished president of two of America's leading universities, and a passionate advocate of university involvement in addressing the challenging issues facing society.""William James McGill was born Feb. 27, 1922, in New York City, the son of a musician and grandson of an Irish immigrant dockworker. Raised in the Bronx, he sold shoes and ran an elevator at Radio City Music Hall as a schoolboy. After receiving bachelor's and master's degrees at Fordham University, he earned the Ph.D. in experimental psychology in 1953 at Harvard University and was an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology until 1956, when he joined Columbia.He was chairman of the psychology department from 1961 to 1963 and left in 1965 to co-found the psychology department at the newly established UCSD campus. His research contributions were at the forefront of advanced knowledge of sensory mechanisms.He published many scientific papers analyzing the flow of sensory information, particularly between the ear and the brain. The week before he died, he and Malvin C. Teich, professor emeritus of engineering science and applied physics at Columbia and now a professor at Boston University, had spent days polishing a final text for a new book. It will propose that the brain amplifies, and in the process adds, a special kind of noise in transmitting visual and auditory signals up the sensory pathways so that we can hear and see both very faint and very strong sound and light. ""It's a book he long wanted to write, and it will be published,"" Dr. Teich said today.In 1968, Dr. McGill chaired a search committee to select a new UCSD chancellor for what was becoming a restless campus. When five finalists refused the offer, he was recruited for the post himself, which he accepted warily. Confrontation ensued when he stood his ground against then-governor Ronald Reagan in re-appointing Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse and when he reasoned with militant students who in sit-ins and teach-ins demanded a curriculum emphasizing Marxist doctrine.His style and courage, as well as his scholarly stature, attracted the search committee at Columbia, and he became the University's 16th president on Sept. 1, 1970, at the age of 48. He immediately faced many of the same anti-war and civil rights protests on a campus memorably struck by student unrest two years earlier. He modernized the administration, created a dialogue with student leaders and finished the job of peacemaking that his predecessor, Andrew W. Cordier, had begun.During his presidency, the University's fund-raising performance recovered dramatically; he balanced the budget and completed $100 million in new construction. New buildings included the Sherman Fairchild Center for the Life Sciences, the Julius and Armand Hammer Health Sciences Center, the International Affairs Building, the Geosciences building at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the Dodge Physical Fitness Center and an expanded Avery Hall. Faculty honors and research advances multiplied across the campus.The concept of general education, pioneered at Columbia in 1919, was expanded to systematically introduce humanities instruction at the graduate and professional levels. Curricular innovations in the schools of architecture, engineering, business and medicine resulted, and a new Center for the Study of Human Rights was established. In 1976, the University created and endowed the Society of Fellows in the Humanities, which supports the work of outstanding young scholars on annual appointments. The programs became models for other American universities.When he announced in 1979 that he would retire the following year, the chairman of the Trustees, Arthur Krim, said: ""You leave Columbia with its academic excellence intact, its campus vibrant, its administration reorganized and its budget in balance. You have won the confidence of students and faculty, not by throttling but by encouraging the rights of dissent so important to an academic environment, yet leading whenever required with a firm and just hand. All this adds up to a considerable personal accomplishment. We Trustees who have lived through these years with you believe it to be the single most outstanding contribution made by any university leader in the past decade to the preservation and enhancement of a great private university.""Dr. McGill returned to UCSD in 1980, became an adjunct professor of psychology and continued his research. In 1983 McGraw-Hill published his book, The Year of the Monkey: Revolt on Campus, in which he chronicled his first year as UCSD chancellor. His office was in William J. McGill Hall, the former psychology-linguistics building named for him in 1990 in honor of his contributions as administrator and scientist.Dr. McGill was awarded 22 honorary degrees and received Columbia's highest honor: the Alexander Hamilton Medal of Columbia College. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, received the Gold Medal of the National Institute for Social Science and was a member of the Society of Experimental Psychologists.He was chairman of the New York State Special Advisory Panel on Medical Malpractice in 1975-76, of the American Council on Education in 1976 and of the Carnegie Commission on the Future of Public Broadcasting in 1977.He is survived by his wife, the former Ann Rowe; a daughter, Mrs. Thomas B. (Rowena) Springer of Reno, Nev.; a son, William R., of San Diego, and two grandsons. The funeral will be private. Memorial services are being planned. --http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/97/19206.html"

He was 80.Mr. Pulitzer died of colon cancer, the publishing company said in a news release.Tall, elegant and reserved, Mr. Pulitzer had, for the last seven years, served primarily as chairman of Pulitzer Publishing, which owns three newspapers, seven television stations and two radio stations. He had led Pulitzer Publishing and its flagship publication, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, for 38 years, serving for 31 of those years as editor and publisher of the newspaper.Mr. Pulitzer relinquished his positions with the paper in 1986 to devote his attention to the company, which went public that year. From 1955 to 1986, he served as chairman of the board of the Pulitzer Prizes, the highest awards in journalism, which were established by his grandfather.Avid Collector of ArtThough principally identified with journalism, Mr. Pulitzer was widely recognized for the art collection he began as a student at Harvard University, a collection that ultimately became one of the most important and generously shared in the world.Art News magazine called Mr. Pulitzer's acquisitions ""one of the most brilliant and comprehensive collections of modern art in the country,"" and John Russell of The New York Times described it as ""one of the most discriminating"" in the nation, saying it was ""as remarkable for range as for quality.""Born on May 13, 1913, Mr. Pulitzer was baptized in the Episcopal Church as Joseph Pulitzer 3d, but he later adopted the junior designation, which his father had dropped after the death of the first Joseph Pulitzer.Mr. Pulitzer graduated from St. Mark's School in Southborough, Mass., in 1932, and went on to earn his bachelor's degree in fine art from Harvard in 1936. His newspaper career began with a stint as a cub reporter for The San Francisco News in 1935, the summer before his senior year at Harvard. After graduating, he joined The Post-Dispatch news staff and helped cover the Roosevelt-Landon campaign of 1936.'Illuminate Dark Places'Over the next 20 years, he worked in every department of the paper, including periods as editor of the daily magazine and editor of the Sunday rotogravure, or pictorial. In 1948, he became associate editor, a position he held until he became editor and publisher on the father's death in 1955.In an editorial he wrote on the day he took over the paper, a week after his father's death, Mr. Pulitzer pledged that The Post-Dispatch would maintain its tradition as one of the nation's great crusading papers. ""We will not only report the day's news but illuminate dark places, and, with a deep sense of responsibility, interpret these troublous times,"" he wrote.At the time, besides the newspaper, Pulitzer holdings included only a radio and television station in St. Louis. But under Joseph Jr.'s guidance, the company bought The Arizona Daily Star in Tucson and The Southtown Economist in Chicago, six other television stations and another radio station.In 1986, the Pulitzer company faced its greatest financial challenge. It had accrued a large debt, and a group of dissident relatives who owned stock in the privately owned company found a buyer, A. Alfred Taubman, a Michigan real estate developer, who offered $625 million for the company. The company successfully resisted the takeover bid, going public with the stock in order to offset its debt.In 1989, the company faced another challenge when Ralph Ingersoll 2d began publishing The St. Louis Sun. Although that newspaper failed after only seven months, its presence spurred the staid Post-Dispatch to improve its coverage.A Litany of FirstsDuring Mr. Pulitzer's tenure as editor, The Post-Dispatch won five Pulitzers, including prizes for commentary and editorial cartooning. In 1987, Mr. Pulitzer received a special citation from the Pulitzer Prize board, citing his ""extraordinary services to American journalism and letters.""The Post-Dispatch was one of the first newspapers in the country to oppose the war in Vietnam, and it was also one of the first to publish excerpts from the Pentagon Papers, the secret history of the war.It was also the first paper in the country to replace the old letter-press printing process with offset cold-type printing, which allowed high-quality color printing. ""Color was of special interest to an art connoisseur like Mr. Pulitzer,"" the company's statement yesterday said, ""and at his insistence The Post-Dispatch moved early into color publication.""Hobby Became a PassionMr. Pulitzer's art collecting began simply enough in 1936 when as an undergraduate he bought Modigliani's ""Elvira Resting at a Table."" Three years later, at an auction in Lucerne, Switzerland, he bought ""Bathers With a Turtle,"" by Matisse for $2,400, a piece that is now easily worth 10,000 times that amount.Mr. Pulitzer's father had no enthusiasm for modern art and sometimes took his friends into his son's room to ridicule the purchases. ""He was convinced that I had been fleeced by shrewd and unscrupulous New York dealers,"" Mr. Pulitzer said in a speech earlier this year.Later, when his father realized the value of his collection and asked where he learned so much about art, Mr. Pulitzer told him that the knowledge had been acquired at Harvard and that the elder Pulitzer had footed the bill.The Pulitzer Collection came to include 86 pieces, all of which were shown at the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Mass., in 1988. The collection could have included Picasso's seminal work ""Demoiselles d'Avignon,"" but Mr. Pulitzer had bought it before World War II and then donated it to the Museum of Modern Art.Mr. Pulitzer always insisted on anonymity when lending his works to museums.His collection included Vuillard's ""Self Portrait,"" and ""Head of a Man"" by Degas, one of Monet's ""Water Lilies,"" as well as works by Braque, Picasso and Miro.Mr. Pulitzer's first wife, Louise Vauclain, died in 1968. He married again in 1973, to the former Emily S. Rauh, who at the time was curator of the St. Louis Art Museum.He is survived by his son, Joseph Pulitzer 4th; his half brother, Michael of St. Louis, two sisters, Kate Davis Quesada of Hobe Sound, Fla., and Elinor Hempelmann of Rochester, and four grandchildren."
12,James Reston,columnist,The New York Times,"[1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980]",,"(Courtesy of The New York Times)James Reston, a Giant of Journalism, Dies at 86By R.W. Apple Jr.December 7, 1995WASHINGTON, Dec. 6— James Reston, former columnist, Washington correspondent and executive editor of The New York Times, died tonight at his home here. He was 86.The cause was cancer, said his son Thomas.First as a reporter and then, beginning in 1953, as a columnist, Mr. Reston was perhaps the most influential journalist of his generation. In Washington, where he was based, and also in other capitals around the world, he had unrivaled access to the high and the mighty. Yet he retained a wry, self-deprecating personality, free of bombast, and always sought to reduce political complexity to plain language.""What I try to do,"" he said, ""is write a letter to a friend who doesn't have time to find out all the goofy things that go on in Washington.""Interested in China and the Soviet Union as well as the United States, a student of diplomacy as well as domestic politics, he won two Pulitzer Prizes and dozens of other awards.Mr. Reston was forgiving of the frailties of soldiers, statesmen and party hacks -- too forgiving, some of his critics later said, because he was too close to them. But his stern moral standards, rooted in the Victorian values of his youth, never wavered. He remained an idealist in a world of cynics.From his strong-minded mother he inherited a Presbyterian conscience and an abiding sense of duty and responsibility. Work hard, he was taught. Work for large goals that transcend self-interest. Be cooperative. Be modest.A talent scout of prodigious capacity, Mr. Reston hired and trained many of The Times's best-known journalists, and served as mentor to many more. To each of them, he passed along a lifetime's lessons about craft and country.Mr. Reston's 50-year association with The Times began when he joined its London bureau on Sept. 1, 1939, the day Hitler's armies marched into Poland, igniting World War II. It was a fitting day on which to start his career at the paper, much of which would be spent recording and reflecting upon the aftermath of that fateful day.His nationally syndicated column appeared regularly until 1987, when he became senior columnist. He retired from The Times in 1989, without ceremony, on his 80th birthday.In an interview marking the occasion, he said the two greatest political triumphs in his lifetime had been the common defense system developed by the West after World War II and the improvement in the lot of black people in America since 1960.Mr. Reston, who was born in Scotland, described the men who met in Philadelphia in 1787 to draft the Constitution as the great heroes in his adopted country's history. The document that they produced, he said, made possible ""the triumph of the moderates"" over the next two centuries.A moderate himself, hostile to both fascism and communism, he described journalism's role in their eclipse as ""one of the great pleasures of my life.""Asked whom he had most admired, he cited Franklin D. Roosevelt as the finest President he had known and Dean Acheson, Secretary of State in the Truman Administration, as ""the key man"" who ""came to the fork in the road"" and concluded that containing the Soviet Union would require a new alliance.But he chose Jean Monnet, the French visionary who conceived the European Community, as the greatest man he had ever known as well as the person who had most deeply influenced his own thinking. Monnet proved, Mr. Reston often said, that ""if you don't demand credit for things, you can push them through.""Mr. Reston thought of himself primarily as a reporter, and he often beat his competitors to be the first to write about major news events. His coverage of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in Washington in 1944, which laid the groundwork for the United Nations, was one of the era's most important exclusives and won him his first Pulitzer, in 1945. Those articles disclosed the substance of secret documents that were then being circulated among delegations from the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and China on the structure of the proposed international organization.Mr. Reston won his second Pulitzer in 1957 for distinguished reporting from Washington. The articles cited were written in June 1956 and analyzed the effects of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's illness on the functioning of the executive branch.He was also responsible for The Times's publication in 1955 of the documents of the 1945 Yalta Conference. And in 1954 he disclosed that J. Robert Oppenheimer, who had directed the making of the first atomic bomb, had subsequently been denied access to secret documents by the Atomic Energy Commission because of suspicion that he was passing information to the Soviet Union, a charge of which Oppenheimer was later cleared.One exclusive dispatch came by accident. In 1971, as one of the first American reporters allowed into China, Mr. Reston developed appendicitis. His report, filed from his bed in the Anti-Imperialist Hospital in the capital, ran on the front page under the headline ""Now, About My Operation in Peking.""From the 1950's on, Mr. Reston interviewed most of the world's leaders, often producing major news accounts that were scrutinized at the State Department for their every nuance. The interviews often bore the special Reston stamp: He sought to reveal not only the policies and the politics of the people he interviewed, but also their vision of life and their view of history.Mr. Reston, who was called Scotty by virtually everyone who knew him, was 5 feet 8 inches tall and had a round and ruddy face, gray-green eyes, an ever-present pipe and an invariably pleasant manner. He was courteous not only to high-level officials but also to the young people who worked for him.""He believes in hard work, in thrift, honor your parents, woman's place is in the home, play by the rules and live clean,"" his colleague Russell Baker once said.Mr. Reston was credited by competitors with having more high-level news sources in Washington than almost any other reporter, although some critics felt that he was too kind in print to some of them. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith, reviewing Mr. Reston's ""The Artillery of the Press,"" a 1967 collection of his talks before the Council on Foreign Relations, suggested that Mr. Reston had learned to his disadvantage ""to treat all people in the manner of a newspaperman who must one day go back and see them again.""But in a 1980 article in The New Republic, Mr. Reston was quoted as saying: ""If you spend your life as a hatchet man -- and there's something to be said for that -- then eventually you find that everybody's out to lunch when you call. You're left with only your own opinion. I wouldn't like that because my own opinions aren't that good.""Writing his column three times a week, Mr. Reston was a procrastinator, often filing right on deadline, to the dismay of night editors at The Times. A two-finger typist, he regularly wore out typewriters because he banged so hard on the keys, and his desk was a litter of papers, many of which bore tiny black marks where a stream of smoldering matches had landed in the course of a never-ending pipe-lighting ritual.His columns, laced with quotations from Walter Lippmann, H. G. Wells, Matthew Arnold and Churchill, were a combination of high moral tone, detailed reporting, allusions to sports, impish humor and evocative descriptions of seasonal changes along the Potomac. They seldom offered absolute judgments about people or events; he used the word ""maybe"" more than most pundits.His first column, on Oct. 18, 1953, established the Reston style.""This town is still full of echoes from the days of America's isolation,"" he wrote of Washington. ""It has changed in policy and personnel, more than any other world capital in the last generation. No nation has taken on so much or moved so far in such a hurry. Yet the habits of the past, like the bent figures of homeless former senators, still haunt the capital.""He often returned to certain themes, such as the role of the press. In his column of Oct. 30, 1968, when Spiro T. Agnew, soon to be elected Vice President, was denouncing news organizations, Mr. Reston wrote:""The candidates and the press are fussing at each other again, and this is the way it should be. They have different jobs, and in many ways they are natural enemies, like cats and dogs. The first job of the candidate is to win, and he usually says what he thinks will help him win. The job of the reporter is to report what happens and decontaminate as much of the political poison as he can. The conflict is obvious.""In addition to his two Pulitzer Prizes, Mr. Reston was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1986 and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Award in 1991. He received the Overseas Press Club award for interpretation of international news three times, the George Polk Memorial Award for national reporting and the French Legion of Honor, and was named Commander, Order of the British Empire. He also received 28 honorary degrees.After retiring, he fulfilled a longtime promise to his wife, Sally, by writing his memoirs. Titled ""Deadline,"" they were published by Random House in 1991.Reviewing the book for The New York Times, Ronald Steel, author of ""Walter Lippmann and the American Century,"" called Mr. Reston ""the quintessential Washington insider.""""Officials used him to test out new ideas on the public or to drop leaks for which they did not want to be held accountable,"" Mr. Steel wrote. ""Because of his high position at The Times and his personal integrity, he was trusted both by those who provided the news and by those who read it.""But what he did so well and so usefully for so long could not be done today. Journalism and the political world have changed too much.""James Barrett Reston began life about as far from the Washington power center as one could get.He was born in Clydebank, Scotland, on Nov. 3, 1909, the son of James, a machinist, and Johanna Irving Reston. The Restons migrated to the United States when he was an infant, but Mrs. Reston became ill, and the family returned to Scotland.There followed years of harsh poverty, of life in a brick tenement where young James and his sister slept crosswise at the foot of their parents' bed. In 1920 the family returned to the United States and settled in Dayton, Ohio. His father worked for the Delco Remy Division of General Motors.When his parents were naturalized, young James automatically became an American citizen. In 1932, he graduated from the University of Illinois with an undistinguished academic record. He had majored in journalism, skipping the course in governmental reporting but getting an A in sportswriting.During his high school years he caddied at the Dayton Country Club golf course. His own game became so good that he twice won the Ohio state public links championship and at Illinois was captain of the Big Ten championship golf team in 1932. His father wanted him to become a golf pro. His mother wanted him to be a preacher, which, he was to say later, is really what he became.In the winters during his school days, he hung around The Dayton Daily News. ""When the phone rang, I'd pick it up and take down the scores,"" he later recalled. ""And from that I just moved into newspapering. I never thought of anything else.""Another link to the world of newspapers was Gov. James M. Cox, the Ohio publisher and 1920 Democratic Presidential candidate, for whom young Reston had caddied. Mr. Cox gave him his first job after college on one of the Cox newspapers in Ohio, The Springfield Daily News, where he earned $10 a week as the sports editor.Later he was hired as traveling secretary and publicity director for the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. In 1934 he moved to New York as a sportswriter for the Associated Press Feature Service.The next year he married Sally Jane Fulton, a former college classmate who had been president of her sorority, an A student and a Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year. Named Sara but always called Sally, she was the daughter of a judge from Sycamore, Ill., a small town near Chicago.Mr. Reston once told a University of Illinois graduating class, ""I should say in passing that I myself married a recklessly beautiful girl whom I first saw on Wright Street wearing a scarlet coat.""""My Gal Sal,"" as he called her in the dedication of ""Sketches in the Sand,"" a collection of his columns published in 1967, became his closest confidante, frequent collaborator and steadiest supporter.They had three sons, Richard, James Jr. and Thomas. Mr. Reston's own happy situation made him a champion of marriage, and he was forever asking his young bachelor colleagues when they were going to wed.In 1937 The Associated Press sent Mr. Reston to London on a rather loose dual assignment: in summer covering sports events, in winter the British Foreign Office.In 1939 he joined The Times and became low man on the totem pole in the London bureau, with a salary of $85 a week. He was so little known on the foreign desk in New York that his first byline in The Times had his name wrong -- John instead of James.Then came the London blitz. The Times's office for much of the war was on the seventh floor of the Reuters Building on Fleet Street, which offered a view of the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral. He described this view of the battle in his first book, ""Prelude to Victory.""""Before we got better sense, we used to put the lights off in the Times office every night and watch this effort,"" he wrote. ""With uncanny regularity, the German bombers would come over just about 10 minutes after blackout and start dropping incendiary bombs all over this section. About an hour before we could see the flames, we would begin to hear the steady throb of scores of engines along the banks of the Thames; these were the pumps, driving the muddy water from the river up through miles of new hose. . . .""A little later the sky would begin to change in color from midnight blue to a reddish glow, and soon the great dome of the cathedral would stand out in silhouette against the flames of perhaps a dozen raging fires. Night after night we watched this incredible scene, and morning after morning we marveled at the fact that the fires were somehow put out.""In December 1940 he was reassigned to Washington, and in 1942 published ""Prelude to Victory,"" a call to action to the American people that was acclaimed here and abroad. Its theme was pure Reston: Unless Americans put aside personal aims and materialistic thinking and made sacrifices in a crusade for their country, the war would not be won.In late 1942, Elmer Davis, head of the Office of War Information, obtained a leave of absence from The Times for Mr. Reston and sent him to London to set up the agency's effort there.John G. Winant, the United States Ambassador to Britain, recommended him to Arthur Hays Sulzberger, then president and publisher of The Times, who was looking for an assistant. It was the beginning of Mr. Reston's close friendship with the Sulzberger family.Mr. Reston returned to Washington and was named national correspondent in 1945. He made his mark with his coverage of Dumbarton Oaks, which illustrated a Reston maxim: Seek out the disgruntled party. His theory was that people who were disenchanted were more likely to talk candidly.In this case, it was the Chinese representatives to the conference who were disenchanted. In his memoirs, Mr. Reston told of having met Chen Yi, one of the Chinese delegates, some years before the war through Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, wife of The Times's publisher. At Mr. Reston's urging, Chen Yi slipped him the complete texts of the proposals.Instead of writing one long article, Mr. Reston doled out the information, producing an exclusive a day. The Russians thought Washington had leaked the material; Washington suspected the British, and the F.B.I. started an investigation of Mr. Reston.In 1948 Mr. Reston became diplomatic correspondent for The Times, and in 1953 he became Washington bureau chief, succeeding Arthur Krock.Mr. Reston continued as bureau chief until 1964, when he voluntarily relinquished the post to concentrate on his column.In 1968 he was summoned to New York by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, who had become publisher, to succeed Turner Catledge as executive editor, in charge of the entire news operation. The internal politics of the news department had received publicity after an unsuccessful effort by editors in New York to exert more control over the Washington bureau. Mr. Reston's mandate was to re-establish peace.For 13 months he ran the news department while commuting to Washington a few times a week to write his column. It was an almost impossible job. In 1969, knowing that his column was suffering and that he had to choose between it and the editor's post, he gladly chose the column.Mr. Reston was eminently a Washington man. He loved and understood the capital. Moreover, he had helped shape the Washington bureau. These were his people, and many of them regarded him as a father figure. The New York office, on the other hand, seemed a vast, impersonal beehive, and Mr. Reston never felt totally comfortable there.During these years the Restons lived in a pleasant red brick house on Woodley Road in leafy northwest Washington and spent weekends at their log cabin in Fiery Run, Va. Mr. Reston often used Fiery Run as the dateline on his Thoreau-like columns about the restorative life in the country.In 1968 the Restons purchased The Vineyard Gazette, a 122-year-old weekly on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where they vacationed in the summer. The paper has remained in the family; their son Richard is editor and publisher, and his wife, Mary Jo, is publisher and general manager.Mr. Reston played a part in the publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 and in two other major news events involving The Times in questions of national security. The others were the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 and the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.In the spring of 1961, The Times was preparing to publish an article by Tad Szulc reporting that 5,000 or 6,000 Cuban exiles who had been training in the United States and in Central America for nine months were about to launch an invasion of Cuba to overthrow the regime of Fidel Castro.The article was planned for page 1 on April 7, under a four-column headline. But Orvil Dryfoos, then the publisher, was troubled by the security implications of the report. On April 6, he and Mr. Catledge, then managing editor, telephoned Mr. Reston, who advised them not to publish the article and cautioned against giving away the proposed timing of the landing as ""imminent.""The article was published on April 7 under a one-column headline and with no mention of the invasion's date. The Bay of Pigs invasion took place 10 days later and ended in debacle. President John F. Kennedy, who took full responsibility, said that if The Times had published more about the operation, it might have saved the Administration from making such a colossal mistake.""If I had it to do over, I would do exactly what we did at the time,"" Mr. Reston said later. ""It is ridiculous to think that publishing the fact that the invasion was imminent would have avoided this disaster.""In 1962 Mr. Reston was apparently the only reporter who had found out that the Soviet Union, then under the leadership of Nikita S. Khrushchev, had secreted nuclear missiles in Cuba, only 90 miles from Florida. When Kennedy realized that Mr. Reston had the information, he telephoned him directly.Four years later, Mr. Reston recounted the incident to E. Clifton Daniel, then managing editor of The Times.""The President told me that he was going on television on Monday evening to report to the American people,"" Mr. Reston recalled. ""He said that if we published the news about the missiles, Khrushchev could actually give him an ultimatum before he went on the air.""I told the President I would report to my office in New York,"" Mr. Reston continued. ""And if my advice was asked, I would recommend that we not publish. It was not my duty to decide.""Kennedy then called Mr. Dryfoos, the publisher, and asked him not to print Mr. Reston's article. Mr. Dryfoos left the matter up to Mr. Reston and his staff, and the article was withheld.It was a different story, however, in 1971 when The Times obtained and published what became known as the Pentagon Papers, the Government's top-secret documents on the Vietnam War. Seeing this at once as ""the story of the century,"" Mr. Reston was one of the editors who felt that the documents should be published because they were history and that therefore no question of national security was involved.One of Mr. Reston's contributions to journalism was the corps of young reporters he discovered and developed.In 1961 he instituted a program of internships for young would-be reporters, modeled on the clerkships at the United States Supreme Court and suggested to him by the late Justice Felix Frankfurter. Each year he would recruit a new college graduate as his clerk and researcher. He paid a price for this program, as time and again the young clerks with lofty journalistic thoughts would mix up his airline reservations or keep the Secretary of State waiting because they had failed to cancel a scheduled appointment.Linda Greenhouse, who went on to report on the Supreme Court for The Times, recalled that on her first day as a clerk, Mr. Reston asked her to get Ted Sorensen on the phone and suggested she try Paul Weiss in New York. After unsuccessfully calling every Weiss-comma-Paul in the Manhattan phone book, she reported back to Mr. Reston.""He didn't groan, tear his hair or -- more important, and the reason for my undying gratitude -- laugh at me,"" Ms. Greenhouse said. ""He gently explained that Paul, Weiss was a New York law firm where Ted Sorensen was working, looked up the number and gave it to me.""It was perhaps this quality, this unfailing kindliness, that constituted his special attractiveness. It enabled him to view the faults and frailties of the world with compassion and to carry on in the belief that the best in mankind would eventually win out over the worst.""Stick with the optimists, Niftie,"" he wrote in a column in February 1980, welcoming his new grandson, Devin Fitzgerald Reston, to the human race. ""It's going to be tough enough even if they're right.""Mr. Reston is survived by his wife; his sons, Richard F. Reston of Martha's Vineyard, James B. Reston Jr. of Chevy Chase, Md., and Thomas B. Reston of Washington; his sister, Joanna Richey of Santa Cruz, Calif., and five grandchildren."

Royster,contributing editor,The Wall Street Journal,"[1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976]",,"New York Times obituary, July 23, 1996Vermont Royster, a former editor of The Wall Street Journal who won two Pulitzer Prizes and helped to shape his newspaper into the country's leading business daily, died yesterday in a retirement community in Raleigh, N.C., The Journal said. He was 82.The Journal said Mr. Royster had been in ill health for several years.Mr. Royster started as a reporter at The Journal in 1936 and worked his way up the ranks, becoming Washington correspondent, Washington bureau chief, editorial writer and editor.Mr. Royster was also a senior vice president for Dow Jones & Company, the newspaper's publisher, and was a director of the company. After his 1971 retirement, he was named editor emeritus of The Journal and continued to write his weekly column, Thinking Things Over, until 1986.Mr. Royster won his first Pulitzer in 1953, for editorial writing. The Pulitzer was awarded not for a specific editorial but for his work in general, which was praised for its ""warmth, simplicity and understanding of the basic outlook of the American people.""In awarding him his second Pulitzer, in 1984, for distinguished commentary, the judges cited his column for its compassion and for putting contemporary events in a historical context.Vermont Connecticut Royster was born in Raleigh. His given names were the same as those of his grandfather, whose own father named his children after states in the Union.Mr. Royster graduated from the University of North Carolina and was a reporter for several newspapers in his home state before joining The Journal.Mr. Royster interrupted his journalistic career to serve in the Navy during World War II. He was on convoy duty in the Atlantic and later served in the Pacific. He commanded a submarine chaser, a gunboat and a destroyer escort.In person and in print, Mr. Royster was known for the gentle tone and rigorous thought that underlay his words. He was, in the words of one fellow journalist, ""a gentle essayist among the shrillers of his time.""In 1953, Mr. Royster deplored the fact that some businessmen were discussing the truce in Korea in terms of bull markets and bear markets. ""War itself is a terrible thing,"" he wrote, ""but we find more terrible the fact that there are men walking about who talk of peace as if it were terrible.""In 1962, Mr. Royster was one of a group of American newspaper editors who had an audience with Nikita S. Khrushchev in which the Soviet leader said that, while he would rather invest in farm machinery than in rockets, his country had an anti-missile missile that could hit ""a fly in outer space.""After retiring from The Journal, Mr. Royster became a professor of journalism and public affairs at the University of North Carolina.In 1967, Mr. Royster's book ""A Pride of Prejudices,"" a collection of some 100 editorials he wrote over two decades, was published by Knopf. His 1983 book, ""My Own, My Country's Time: A Journalist's Journey,"" published by Algonquin Books, was an account of his childhood, his combat experiences and his years as a journalist.In 1986, Mr. Royster received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award. Mr. Royster, President Reagan said, had a common sense ""that exploded the pretensions of 'expert opinion,' and his compelling eloquence warned of the evils of a society loosed from its moorings in faith.""Mr. Royster is survived by his wife, Frances, and two daughters."
14,Eugene C. Patterson,chairman and chief executive officer,St. Petersburg Times,"[1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985]",,"Eugene C. Patterson, Editor and Civil Rights Crusader, Dies at 89By Robert D. McFaddenJanuary 13, 2013Eugene C. Patterson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning editor of The Atlanta Constitution during the civil rights conflicts of the 1960s and later the managing editor of The Washington Post and editor of The St. Petersburg Times in Florida, died on Saturday in St. Petersburg. He was 89.The cause was complications from cancer, said George Rahdert, Mr. Patterson’s lawyer and longtime friend, who said he had been sick since last February.In 41 years as a reporter, editor and news executive, Mr. Patterson, who won the 1967 Pulitzer for editorial columns, was one of America’s most highly regarded journalists — a plain-talking, hard-driving competitor known for fairness and integrity as the nation confronted racial turmoil, divisions over the Vietnam War and new ethical challenges in journalism.Mr. Patterson succeeded the celebrated Ralph McGill as editor of The Constitution, and from 1960 to 1968 was a voice of conscience and progressive politics on the editorial page. He wrote thousands of columns, many of which addressed white Southerners directly, like letters from home, and cumulatively painted a portrait of the South during the civil rights struggle.Raised on Georgia farm and serving as a tank commander in World War II, he worked at small-town newspapers in Texas and Georgia as a young man, and although he moved up to wire service jobs in New York and London, he had been steeped in the droll wit and down-home sociability of the South.There were no simple solutions to the racial problems, and he offered none. Instead, he drew poignant scenes of suffering and loss to condemn violence and miscarriages of justice. And he explored themes of courage and questions of responsibility that went beyond mindless acts of racism to challenge a people with traditions of decency.At the ruins of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., where a bomb killed four girls on Sept. 15, 1963, he crafted his most famous column, “A Flower for the Graves.” Walter Cronkite was so moved that he asked Mr. Patterson to read it on the “CBS Evening News.”It began: “A Negro mother wept in the street Sunday morning in front of a Baptist Church in Birmingham. In her hand she held a shoe, one shoe, from the foot of her dead child. We hold that shoe with her. Every one of us in the white South holds that small shoe in his hand.”He also protested the Georgia legislature’s refusal to seat Julian Bond, the black civil rights leader, for opposing American involvement in Vietnam and supporting draft resisters. His exclusion was overturned by the United States Supreme Court in 1966, and Mr. Bond served 20 years in the legislature.Mr. Patterson joined The Washington Post in 1968 as managing editor, succeeding Benjamin C. Bradlee, who became executive editor. The two led the newsroom in June 1971 when The Post followed The New York Times in publishing the Pentagon Papers, the secret study of American duplicity in Indochina. Nixon administration challenges to both publications were struck down in a historic Supreme Court ruling.Later in 1971, Mr. Patterson left The Post and taught for a year at Duke University. In 1972 he became editor of The St. Petersburg Times (now known as The Tampa Bay Times) and two sister publications, The Evening Independent in St. Petersburg and Congressional Quarterly, covering the government in Washington. After the death of the publications’ owner, Nelson Poynter, in 1978, he became the company’s chairman until his own retirement in 1988.Under Mr. Patterson, The Times’s liberal traditions flourished on Florida’s largely conservative west coast, with foreign and national news reports and strong investigative articles. In 1976, he insisted that news of his own arrest on a drunken-driving charge appear on Page 1 to show that the paper could be as hard on its own as it was on others.Eugene Corbett Patterson was born on Oct. 15, 1923, in Valdosta, Ga., to William C. and Annabel Corbett Patterson. He grew up on a farm, did office work for The Adel News, edited a campus newspaper at North Georgia College at Dahlonega and majored in journalism at the University of Georgia at Athens, graduating in 1943.He joined the Army in World War II, became a tank platoon commander in Gen. George S. Patton’s Third Army, and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. After Germany’s defeat he sailed for the Pacific, but learned on the way of Japan’s surrender. He became an Army pilot after the war, but left the service in 1947 to go into journalism.In 1950, he married Mary Sue Carter. She died in 1999. Mr. Patterson, who lived in St. Petersburg, is survived by their daughter, Mary Patterson Fausch, and three grandchildren.Mr. Patterson was a reporter for The Temple Daily Telegram in Texas and The Macon Telegraph in Georgia in 1947 and 1948 and worked for United Press in Atlanta in 1948, in New York in 1949 and in London as bureau chief from 1953 to 1956. He then became vice president and executive editor of The Atlanta Journal and The Constitution, both owned by Cox Enterprises, and four years later was named editor of The Constitution.From 1964 to 1968, Mr. Patterson was vice chairman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, an appointee of President Lyndon B. Johnson. He was president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in 1977 and 1978, and served from 1974 to 1985 on Columbia’s Pulitzer Prize Board, selecting winners of those prestigious awards in journalism and the arts.In 1981, Mr. Patterson was one of the few board members who opposed a feature-writing Pulitzer for Janet Cooke of The Washington Post for an article about an 8-year-old heroin addict, which proved to be a hoax. He objected because the article was about an anonymous boy and relied on unnamed sources. The Pulitzer was returned, Ms. Cooke resigned, and the episode was a profound embarrassment for The Post.Mr. Patterson also scoffed at the idea of journalists posing as someone else to get a story. “If this becomes the standard for news coverage in America, then we have set a standard that young reporters are going to follow, and misrepresenting oneself, misleading, camouflaging one’s identity, will become a way of life,” he said in a discussion on the CBS News program “60 Minutes.”In a newsroom with his sleeves rolled up or at an awards ceremony in a tuxedo, he carried himself with military bearing, a stocky, barrel-chested man with the rolling gait of James Cagney, whom he resembled in style and grit. Colleagues said he seemed always to be on the verge of a smile or a good idea.“Every day you had to have an idea,” he said in 2003 of his column-writing years. “You kept your pockets stuffed with quotations and ideas and turns of thought, famous sayings that you could credit and work into your columns. At laundry time, you had an awful lot of chewed-up paper in your pockets.”In 2002, a collection of his columns for The Constitution was published as a book, “The Changing South of Gene Patterson: Journalism and Civil Rights, 1960-1968.” He was the author of “Patton’s Unsung Armor of the Ardennes: The Tenth Armored Division’s Secret Dash to Bastogne” (2008). A chair in journalism was established in his name at Duke, where he was a trustee from 1988 to 1994.In a 2008 interview with Florida Trend magazine, Mr. Patterson remembered a day when his daughter, Mary, then 9, called him at The Constitution. She was sobbing. Someone had shot her dog in the backyard. He hurried home. “I kept telling my daughter, ‘Look, we don’t know who shot her,’ ” he recalled. “But my daughter said she knew — that it was ‘somebody who doesn’t like what you’ve been writing in the paper.’ ”“I tried to explain to her,” he said. “It was tough for a child.”But there was no turning back. “You had to address the issue of race relations because the civil rights marchers were in the streets, the sit-ins were going on, the riots, the fire hoses, the police dogs, the killings,” he said. “This had to be addressed and not simply by reporting it, but by editors who would stand up and say what we had been doing was wrong, and we had to change.”Correction: January 18, 2013 An obituary on Monday about the newspaper editor Eugene C. Patterson misidentified his birthplace. It is Valdosta, Ga., — not Adel, a small town where his family moved when he was a child.Michael Schwirtz contributed reporting."
15,Thomas Winship,inaugural fellow,Gannett Center for Media Studies,"[1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985]",,"(Courtesy of The New York Times)Thomas Winship, Ex-Editor of Boston Globe, Dies at 81By Douglas MartinMarch 15, 2002Thomas Winship, who as editor of The Boston Globe for two decades propelled the newspaper to regional leadership and national stature, in part through tireless coverage of the court-ordered school busing that split the city in the 1970's, died yesterday in Boston. He was 81 and lived in Lincoln, Mass.He had been under care for lymphoma at Massachusetts General Hospital, said his son Laurence.Mr. Winship, who started out as a reporter in Washington, grew up in a newspaper family. His grandfather A. E. Winship had been editor of The Boston Traveller. His father, Laurence, joined The Globe in 1911 as a reporter and was named editor in 1955. Thomas Winship succeeded him in 1965 and by his retirement in 1984 built The Globe's circulation and prestige in a period of often disruptive economic and social change. At the height of the busing dispute, bullets flew through The Globe's newsroom windows.Mr. Winship made The Globe the third newspaper, after The New York Times and The Washington Post, to defy government secrecy and publish the Pentagon papers on the Vietnam War. His staff covered the school busing crisis with such voluminous and balanced reporting that it was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1975. The paper won 12 Pulitzer Prizes under his leadership.Mr. Winship fit the mold of the crusading big-city editor, a position made easier because, until 1981, he directed both the news and editorial pages, roles that are usually separate at major newspapers. The Globe was the second major newspaper, after The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, to call for American withdrawal from Vietnam.Often, in the view of critics and admirers, Mr. Winship's advocacy was apparent not just in editorials but in the news pages. For example, when The Globe campaigned for handgun control and a bottle-redemption bill, Time magazine said, the newspaper ran hundreds of articles that argued for its views.In ''Common Ground,'' by J. Anthony Lukas (Knopf 1985), a pain staking examination of the way court-ordered racial integration affected three Boston families, Mr. Winship was quoted as calling traditional journalistic objectivity ''a code word for playing it safe.''Mr. Winship did not shrink from pursuing stories wherever they went. He said his most painful decision was to publish an investigation of the finances of the liberal Republican Edward W. Brooke, the first black United States senator since Reconstruction. The inquiry contributed greatly to Senator Brooke's defeat in 1978.Mr. Winship believed that quality journalism was good business, and he proved it, expanding The Globe's coverage of sports, science and the arts. When he began, there were five newspapers in Boston and The Globe was just beginning to pull ahead of The Boston Herald in circulation. In his tenure The Globe's daily circulation rose by 40 percent, to 520,000, and Sunday circulation by 50 percent, to 792,786. The newspaper became dominant, though some purists worried that its focus had become more suburban as its circulation crept ever outward.In the newsroom, in the corridors of Harvard and at the journalism conventions he loved to attend, Mr. Winship's casual flamboyance -- reflected in flowered bow ties, red suspenders and the battered pickup truck he drove to work -- was reinforced by the breezy affability of an Irish politician.''Whadya say, pal? Howya doing?'' he would call to colleagues.With his own sense of style, this WASP scion (though not a Boston Brahmin) worked to bridge the gap between The Globe and its readers.Thomas Winship was born in Cambridge, Mass., on July 1, 1920. Soon after, his family moved to Sudbury, a farming community 16 miles west of Boston. His family was of modest means, and his early education was unusual.The industrialist Henry Ford had discovered a one-room schoolhouse linked by legend to the story of Mary and her little lamb. He installed it on a Sudbury hillside and furnished it with 19th-century desks and a potbellied stove. He then recruited a teacher and 16 local children, Tom Winship among them.When Mr. Ford produced a movie about Mary and the lamb, Tom's job was to hide the animal under his desk until the director was ready for it.Mr. Winship followed his father to Harvard, where he founded the ski club and met Elizabeth Coolidge, who became his wife. She survives him, as do a sister, Joanna Crawford of Lincoln, Mass.; two sons, Laurence, of Minneapolis, and Benjamin, of Victor, Idaho; two daughters, Margaret, of Eagle Bridge, N.Y., and Joanna, of Minneapolis; and eight grandchildren.After graduating from Harvard in 1942, Mr. Winship took laboring jobs and then joined the Coast Guard. He served as a combat correspondent aboard a troop ship on D-Day. After the war, while working at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, he got a night job writing obituaries for The Washington Post. He continued at the paper, covering the police, after his discharge.He considered himself apolitical and said he was surprised when Senator Leverett Saltonstall, a Massachusetts Republican, offered him a job as press secretary. The experience awakened a political streak in the young man, who became a Democrat. He said he thought Republicans were too negative.Mr. Winship returned to The Post for six years, then joined The Globe as its Washington correspondent. He returned to Boston in 1958 to be metropolitan editor, then managing editor.He was in charge when The Globe broke the news that Senator Edward M. Kennedy had cheated on a test as a Harvard undergraduate. Later, as executive editor, he published a series of articles on the senator's auto accident at Chappaquiddick that Mr. Kennedy called ''ugly, untrue and grossly unfair.''Yesterday, Mr. Kennedy said in a statement that Mr. Winship ''was truly the hallmark of what a newspaper editor should be.''Succeeding his father in 1965, he immediately defined himself as his own man by taking on the remnants of McCarthyism, decaying neighborhoods and racial segregation, subjects on which his father on which his father's Globe had often declined to comment. The Globe won its first Pulitzer Prize for articles on the unsuitability for the federal bench of Francis X. Morrissey, a Kennedy family retainer.Mr. Winship broke more new ground by banning advertisements from the front page and eliminating the signature ''Uncle Dudley'' from editorials, which had been a folksy tradition at The Globe. The newspaper also made its first political endorsement in 72 years, for Kevin H. White over Louise Day Hicks, a school board member and busing opponent, in the 1967 mayoral race. He signed up columnists like Ellen Goodman and Peter Gammons, the baseball writer.After his retirement from The Globe, he was the first senior fellow at the Gannett Center for Media Studies (now the Freedom Forum) and the founding chairman of the Center for Foreign Journalists, a nonprofit institute offering seminars for Third World journalists.Two decades after the swirling, violent fight over integrating Boston schools, Mr. Winship said his biggest disappointment in journalism was not suggesting more nuanced approaches. But he said he still believed that his support for integration was absolutely right."

LucekJune 23, 2004Clayton Kirkpatrick, a former editor of The Chicago Tribune who presided over a sweeping transformation of the newspaper's editorial approach, died Saturday at his home in Glen Ellyn, Ill., a suburb of Chicago. He was 89.The cause was congestive heart failure, The Tribune reported yesterday.Mr. Kirkpatrick was The Tribune's editor from 1969 to 1979. He took the job when the newspaper adhered to traditions of partisan reporting that had originated under Col. Robert R. McCormick, a former owner who died in 1955. According to its own account yesterday, The Tribune ''had been the Republican bible for the first half of the 20th century,'' and, until Mr. Kirkpatrick was made editor on Jan. 1, 1969, ''was caught in a time warp.''Mr. Kirkpatrick immediately wrote an editorial telling Tribune readers that they could expect changes in both the editorial page and news columns, and that ''no political party should take The Tribune for granted.''In the years that followed, Mr. Kirkpatrick encountered resistance from conservative members of the Tribune Company's board and complaints from readers, but in the long run the newspaper reversed a lengthy decline in circulation and increased its profits under Mr. Kirkpatrick's leadership.At the height of the Watergate scandals in May 1974, the newspaper demonstrated its break with its past with a 44-page special section that contained the entire transcript of President Richard M. Nixon's Watergate-related conversations. Eight days later, a Tribune editorial that was headlined ''Listen, Mr. Nixon'' called on him to resign.Mr. Kirkpatrick also introduced new specialized sections and changed the appearance of The Tribune, using more photographs and graphic material. In the case of the Moon landing in 1969, the normal front page mix of type and headlines was replaced with one huge headline, three short paragraphs of large type and a photograph of the Moon's surface.Mr. Kirkpatrick was born on Jan. 8, 1915, and grew up in Waterman, Ill. He attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he graduated in 1937.A year later, he was hired as a reporter by the City News Bureau, a news service in Chicago, and he became a local reporter at The Tribune that year.He enlisted in the Army in 1942, and was awarded a Bronze Star before his discharge in 1945.At The Tribune, he worked his way from an editor on the copy desk to city editor in 1961. He was made assistant managing editor in 1963, managing editor in 1965 and executive editor in 1967.After his 10 years as editor, Mr. Kirkpatrick was made president and chief executive of the Tribune Company in 1979 and retired in 1981.Mr. Kirkpatrick's wife, Thelma, died in 1998. He is survived by two sons, Bruce and James; two daughters, Eileen Vaughan and Pamela Kirkpatrick; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren."
17,Elie Abel,"dean, Graduate School of Journalism",Columbia University,"[1976, 1977, 1978]",,"Elie Abel, Newsman and Teacher, Dies at 83 July 24, 2004 by Jacques SteinbergElie Abel, a former foreign and domestic correspondent at both The New York Times and NBC News who drew on those experiences as dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University in the 1970's, died on Thursday at a hospice in Rockville, Md. He was 83. The cause was pneumonia, said his son, Mark, but Mr. Abel had been in declining health since 1998, when he had a severe stroke. He also had Alzheimer's disease.In nearly a quarter of a century as a working journalist, Mr. Abel saw a great deal of the country and the world. In one of his earliest newspaper jobs, he spent two years in Berlin in the late 1940's as a foreign correspondent for the North American Newspaper Alliance, covering the Nuremberg war-crimes trials and the early attempts to govern postwar Germany. In 1949, he joined The Times, which sent him initially to Detroit and Washington, before appointing him bureau chief in Belgrade (1956 to 1959) and New Delhi (1958-1959.)He left The Times in 1959 to spend two years at The Detroit News, as its Washington bureau chief, before beginning a six-year career at NBC that included tours as State Department correspondent, London bureau chief and chief diplomatic correspondent.In December 1969, Mr. Abel was named dean of the journalism school of Columbia, from which he had graduated with a masters degree 27 years earlier. ''If you had asked me a year ago if I had any interest in this job, I would probably have said you were out of your mind,'' Mr. Abel was quoted as telling The Times, in a profile announcing his appointment. ''I decided I had done my share of running around the world and in more recent years of running to airports with microphones in my hand.''In a decade as dean, Mr. Abel was credited with many innovations, including the creation, in the mid-1970's, of a program in economics and business reporting for midcareer professionals. The program is now known as the Knight-Bagheot Fellowship. He was also the first dean to place a woman in a tenure track position on the faculty of the journalism school, according to ''Pulitzer's School: Columbia University's School of Journalism, 1903-2003,'' by James Boylan. She is Phyllis T. Garland, a former editor and writer at The Pittsburgh Courier and Essence magazine who was hired at Columbia in 1973 and who retired last month. ''We totally respected him,'' Ms. Garland said in an interview yesterday. ''He was a complete journalist. And he put himself on the line when necessary. He was also one of the best-looking men I've ever seen. Tall, dark and handsome.''Elie Abel was born in Montreal on Oct. 17, 1920. After graduating from McGill University in 1941 with a bachelor of arts degree, Mr. Abel earned his masters in science at Columbia a year later, but was forced to accept his degree in absentia because he was called to serve in the Royal Canadian Air Force, according to the profile in The Times. Stationed primarily in Scotland, he served as a radar officer and later as a combat correspondent. A day after his discharge, in 1945, he joined the staff of The Montreal Gazette.Mr. Abel's first wife, the former Corinne Adelaide Prevost, died in 1991 after 45 years of marriage. In addition to his son, of Richmond, Calif., he is survived by his second wife, the former Charlotte Hammond Page Dunn, whom he married in 1995; a daughter, Suzanne, of Palo Alto, Calif.; and a granddaughter. Mr. Abel was the author or co-author of six books, including ''The Missile Crisis'' (Lippincott, 1966) and, with W. Averell Harriman, ''Special Envoy to Churchill and Stalin, 1941-1946'' (Random House, 1975).When he was interviewed by The Times in 1969 at the time of his Columbia appointment, Mr. Abel recalled a pivotal encounter, at the age of 12 or 13, with a ''dashing fellow'' who happened to be driving a flashy convertible. ''How did you manage all this?'' Mr. Abel recalled asking. ''I'm a reporter,'' the man replied. The author of The Times profile, Lawrence Van Gelder, then observed, 'Mr. Abel's course in life was likely charted right then and there.''-- http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/24/us/elie-abel-newsman-and-teacher-dies-at-83.html?pagewanted=print"

""Tim"" Hays Jr., the Harvard-educated lawyer who chose a newspaperman's life and led what became The Press-Enterprise into national prominence as a Pulitzer Prize-winning advocate of open government and defender of the First Amendment, died Friday in St. Louis. He was 94.Mr. Hays had been struggling with Alzheimer's disease, his son Tom Hays said Friday. He said his father died in the afternoon at Barnes-Jewish Hospital following a brief acute illness.Mr. Hays spent 51 years at The Press-Enterprise. He was an FBI special agent during World War II and joined the newspaper as assistant editor in 1946. He passed the bar the same year but never practiced law.His subsequent roles included editor, co-publisher, publisher and chairman. He continued as chairman until 1997, when The Press-Enterprise was sold to the A.H. Belo Co., ending 67 years of family ownership of the Riverside-based newspaper.The news organization's five-story office on Fourteenth Street was named in 2006 as the Howard H. ""Tim"" Hays Media Center.""Tim was a rarity, a man whose moral compass was set on true,"" said Mel Opotowsky, the former managing editor of The Press-Enterprise. ""That is especially important as a newspaper owner because of the obligation as a public trust. There are many instances of Tim's beneficence, not only to his employees, but to his readers and to principles of quality journalism.""Mr. Hays once joked that his choice of journalism over law and his âsemi-meteoric rise at the newspaper were due to ""diligence, and the fact that my father was co-owner.""Courtly, soft-voiced and with a penchant for remembering anyone's name, from civic leaders to cleaning crews in the hallways of his newspaper, Mr. Hays' personality contrasted sharply with flamboyant news-executive contemporaries. His memos were to his ""Fellow Employees.""But his reserved manner was matched with a steely resolve.He stood up to pressure and confrontation to lead his newspaper to a Pulitzer Prize. He took two open-government cases to the U.S. Supreme Court, winning both.Media attorneys use shorthand to refer to two landmark cases won by the newspaper, Press-Enterprise One and Two.In January 1984, the newspaper won a case establishing the public's right to attend jury selection in criminal trial proceedings. In a 1986 case, the court asserted the right of the public to attend pre-trial hearings in criminal cases with few exceptions.Mr. Hays oversaw publication of a series of articles in 1967 that exposed malpractice in the conservatorship program for Agua Caliente Indians in Palm Springs. Editorials combined with more than 100 stories, mostly written by reporter George Ringwald, earned the newspaper the Pulitzer Prize for meritorious public service in 1968. (Ringwald died in 2005.)During the newspaper's reporting of that issue, a judge who was under investigation became infuriated by a Press-Enterprise editorial and ordered Mr. Hays arrested.The publisher stood his ground and was not jailed.Mr. Hays also stood by his reporters, even as advertisers took their business away in protest over investigative pieces.Despite national recognition, Mr. Hays kept his community at the foreground of his work. He was among the civic leaders who worked to get a University of California campus established here. UC Riverside opened in 1954.""Tim had a very active mind that saw beyond the ordinary but was able to bring it down to earth,"" said his former executive secretary, Jean Wingard. ""He was an excellent newsman, and had the respect of those who worked with him and for him.""Mr. Hays established the Hays Press-Enterprise Lecture in 1966, which was underwritten in 1998 by a $100,000 endowment after the newspaper was sold.The free lectures, open to the public, featured leaders in news media, including retired Washington Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee; Gene Roberts, former managing editor of the New York Times; and W. Thomas Johnson, who was then president of Cable News Network.Mr. Hays also undertook the cause of preserving the Mission Inn.He and other civic leaders maintained their effort during a seven-year stretch in which the state and national historic landmark in downtown Riverside was closed at one time surrounded by a chain-link fence.Several attempts to reopen the Inn failed. Some suggested the land was a prime spot for a parking lot. In 1992, Duane Roberts bought the hotel and invested millions of dollars in renovations.The Press-Enterprise under Mr. Hays also quietly helped to underwrite local cultural and arts organizations.""I am not married to any cause,"" Mr. Hays once said. ""I believe in generosity to the community in which you live. I think you can contribute more with time and energy than with dollars. But I guess the money can be pretty dandy, too.""Retired appellate court Justice John Gabbert said Mr. Hays, similar to his brothers, developed his sense of community engagement early in life.""He was motivated by the very strong civic background that he probably inherited from his father,"" Gabbert said Friday. ""They were all there, out in the community, making it better.""Contemporaries of Mr. Hays said he was less likely to deliver a fiery speech, and more likely to argue his points over lunch or in a casual conversation. Former state Sen. Robert Presley said each time he would meet Mr. Hays at the same downtown Riverside restaurant, the publisher would prod him for support of downtown Riverside projects.""He didn't seem to have a lot of ego, although he could be vigorous and persuasive in his arguments,"" Presley said Friday from Sacramento.""He was a very special person,"" said Marcia McQuern who worked for Hays at The Press-Enterprise and eventually became the paper's publisher. ""He had a true journalist's heart. He always tried to live up to his standards and ideals.""McQuern remembered Hays being well tied into the community. So much so that he often knew what was going on before his reporters did.""I would come to him with a story and he'd say, 'You finally found that out,' she said. But he never would kill anything.""Even when it may have been unpopular among the community leaders he mingled with.""He took a lot of heat. He really stuck by the newsroom. That's where his heart was,"" she said.McQuern remembered one instance where the paper wanted the name behind a large anonymous donation to UC Riverside.""We fought for access,"" she said. ""He let us go fight for the information. We were about to file suit and he finally admitted it was him.""Howard H. ""Tim"" Hays Jr. was born in Chicago on June 2, 1917, the son of Howard H Hays Sr. and Margaret Mauger Hays. He came to Riverside with his parents in 1924.A graduate of Riverside Polytechnic High School, he was editor of the school newspaper, Poly Spotlight, during his senior year.Mr. Hays earned a bachelor's degree in social sciences at Stanford University, graduating in 1939.In 1942, he received a law degree from Harvard Law School. After his service with the FBI, he briefly served as a reporter at the San Bernardino Sun before joining the family newspaper and beginning his leadership role in American journalism.Mr. Hays moved to St. Louis part time in 1989, and began living there full time after his retirement from The Press-Enterprise, his son Tom said.In a message read at the 2007 dedication of the news building named after him, Mr. Hays noted that he still read every day the newspaper that he had led for so long.Survivors include wife Susie Hays of St. Louis, sons Bill Hays of Corona Del Mar and Tom Hays of New York City, and brother Dan Hays of Riverside. His brother, William H. Hays, died earlier this year. Mr. Hays' first wife, Helen Hays Yeager, died two years earlier, to the day, of Mr. Hays' death.The family was still considering memorial services, Tom Hays said Friday. The family requested that donations in lieu of flowers be made to the UCR Foundation, 120A Highlander Hall, 900 University Ave., Riverside CA 92521.The website is ucr.edu/giving.Said Tom Hays, ""He lived a very long and productive and fortunate life, and he died very peacefully, so we are thankful for that."""

Leonard always knew he wanted to be a newspaperman — correction, make that editor — ever since he worked on his fifth-grade newspaper back in Ridgewood, N.J.And he did just that.In 1967, Leonard was named the sixth editor of The Milwaukee Journal. He served longer than any other editor in the history of the newspaper, with the exception of Lucius W. Nieman, who founded it in 1882.Leonard, 92, died of natural causes Sunday in Milwaukee.He worked at The Journal for 39 years, including 18 as its top editor, where he celebrated the paper winning two Pulitzer Prizes, embraced the concept of a newspaper ombudsman, founded the Sunday Journal's weekly magazine Insight, championed the hiring of women and minorities in the newsroom and boosted international coverage by sending Journal reporters and photographers to foreign countries and to cover the Vietnam War.""He was a believer in bringing the world to Wisconsin,"" said Sig Gissler, who succeeded Leonard as editor. ""I think that was one of the distinctive features of The Milwaukee Journal for many years.""Leonard made extensive reporting and study trips to Europe, Africa, South America, Asia, the Soviet Union, the Middle East and was among the first journalists to enter China after President Richard Nixon's historic visit.He actually became a world traveler before he became a professional journalist. Enlisting in the Army after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he served in the Transportation Corps in Europe, the Philippines, New Guinea and Japan during and after World War II.Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., and raised in Ridgewood, N.J., he enrolled at the University of Wisconsin in Madison in 1939. He worked as editor for the Daily Cardinal, where he met his wife, Barbara. He returned to college after the war, earned a journalism degree in 1947 and was hired by The Milwaukee Journal.Leonard never forgot his first Journal assignment. He was sent to an interview at the old Schroeder Hotel, now the Hilton Milwaukee City Center. Suddenly a body hurtled past the window, in what would turn out to be a suicide. Leonard's news instincts kicked in and he planned to go after the story, first calling the city desk.""We'll send a reporter right over!"" someone on the desk told him.""That,"" Leonard recalled, ""was the biggest put-down I've ever experienced.""After that, he had nowhere to go but up.Leonard next worked on the newspaper's picture desk and then its Madison bureau. He handled state news in 1951 and became state editor in 1952. By 1962, he was managing editor. Leonard covered everything from stories on the notorious Ed Gein murders to visits by Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower.""I saw Truman in Madison when he was running for election against Dewey in 1948,"" said Leonard, noting that Truman wasn't given much of a chance of winning. ""He joked about the Republicans putting 'two veterans in every garage,' and he cracked some other jokes, getting tremendous applause, tremendous laughter — a great reaction. I felt right then that he was going to win the election, even though the odds were heavily against him.""In another political encounter, Leonard caught up with Eisenhower in Madison.""I stopped him,"" Leonard said, ""and asked him if there was any truth to the rumors that he was going to run for president. He said absolutely not, and he poked his finger in my chest and added that 'if anybody asks you who said so, you tell them that Ike told you he's not going to run for president.' That story was a big thing for me, except that a week later Eisenhower announced his candidacy.""Bob Wills worked with Leonard at The Journal and moved to the Milwaukee Sentinel as city editor when The Journal bought its rival in 1962. Then they became competitors professionally while remaining personal friends, traveling on vacations with their wives.""He was very thorough, very forward looking, very good humored. He wanted a paper that would be of interest to everyone in the metropolitan area,"" said Wills.Howard Fibich was hired to work at The Journal in 1956 and rose through the ranks to deputy managing editor before retiring in 1994.""I thought Dick Leonard was the best editor we had,"" said Fibich. ""I'll always remember him for the things he didn't do. He did not micromanage. ... No one wanted to disappoint Dick.""Leonard was involved with numerous journalism organizations, including the International Press Institute, Society of Professional Journalists and the Milwaukee Press Club. After retiring from The Journal, he worked in Honolulu for four years as Editor-in-Residence at the East-West Center, a government exchange program for American and Pacific Rim journalists. He was an assistant professor of communications at Marquette University for many years, spent a decade on the Pulitzer Prize Board and served on Harvard University's Nieman Fellowship selection committee.He is survived by his wife and two daughters, Laurie Leonard and Lisa Heck. Services are pending.Former Journal Sentinel staff writer Amy Silvers contributed to this report. "

Baker, a professor of journalism at Columbia University for 34 years and retired secretary of the Pulitzer Prize Board, died of cancer yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 68 years old.Mr. Baker, who was an ordained Methodist minister, had been a correspondent and journalism teacher in China during World War II. He served as acting dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism from August 1968 to February 1970. In 1953-54, he took a year out from teaching to work as a reporter for The New York Times.Yesterday he was called ""one of the finest, if not the finest, journalism professors in the country when measured by the results of his teaching."" The praise came in a joint statement by J. Montgomery Curtis, former editor of the American Press Institute, who is now a consultant to the Knight-Ridder newspapers, and John Hohenberg, a Columbia professor emeritus, who is now teaching at the University of Florida.The dean of the Columbia journalism school, Osborn Elliott, said, ""Dick Baker was a source of strength, integrity and caring,"" who ""left an important imprint on journalists and journalism throughout the world.""Mr. Baker, who was born in Coggon, Iowa, on March 27, 1913, graduated from Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, in 1934. He worked for The Cedar Rapids (Iowa) Gazette and then earned a Columbia journalism degree in 1937. Under a Pulitzer traveling fellowship, he went to 32 countries in the Orient, Africa and the Middle East.Combining journalism and religion, he worked for Methodist publications and received divinity degrees from the Union Theological Seminary in New York City in 1941 and Cornell College in Iowa in 1946.In 1943, when the Chinese Nationalist Government and Columbia set up a journalism school in China's wartime capital, Chungking, he served for two years as one of five American faculty members and as acting dean. He also was a correspondent for Religious News Service.In 1947, he joined the Columbia journalism faculty. From 1961 to 1968, he served as associate dean. As acting dean he was a calm peacemaker after student uprisings in 1968.He served as a State Department adviser on religious journalism in West Germany in 1950, and was a visiting professor at National Chengchi University in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1968.In May 1976, Mr. Baker was elected secretary of the board of newspaper executives for the Pulitzer Prizes in journalism, letters, drama and music, succeeding Mr. Hohenberg.Mr. Baker, who retired in July, had a home in the Thousand Islands in upstate New York, where he was an avid gardener. Last spring, the Pulitzer Board gave him a scroll for ""conscientious and able representation."" When he became professor emeritus, scores of letters from students and friends were collected in a presentation book.Mr. Baker wrote six books, including works on Asian affairs, ""The Christian as a Journalist"" and ""A History of the Graduate School of Journalism.""He is survived by his wife, the former Marjorie Coleman; a son, Coleman of Waterbury Center, Vt., and three sisters, Ruth Thompson of North Scituate, Mass., Beth Mast of Davenport, Iowa, and Marjorie Fish of Cedar Falls.After private cremation, a memorial service is to be arranged early next month in St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia.

Phillips,chairman and chief executive officer,Dow Jones & Co.,"[1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987]",,"(Courtesy of Queens College)Warren Phillips was born on June 28, 1926 and raised in Forest Hills, New York. Early on, he demonstrated an affinity for reporting – at the age of twelve, he collected news items and created a home newspaper, “The Snoopy Scoop.” He attended Queens College from 1942-1947, which was briefly interrupted by his enlistment in the armed forces after American entry into World War II. The war ended before he could be deployed, and upon his return, he began to devote himself to a career as a “newspaperman”, as journalists were then called.Although he had difficulty gaining admittance to graduate journalism programs, he was able to secure a position as a proofreader at The Wall Street Journal. In 1949, he briefly left the Journal to work for the United States Army newspaper Stars and Stripes, stationed in Germany. He continued to submit freelance pieces to the Journal during this time, and soon returned as its official German correspondent. He covered events there as well as in Greece and Turkey. In 1950, he was transferred to London, where he became London Bureau Chief and met Barbara Thomas, whom he married in 1951.Also in 1951, he was promoted to Foreign Editor, working out of New York. In 1954, the year his first child, Lisa, was born, he was appointed the second Managing Editor of the Journal’s Midwest Edition in Chicago. His second child, Leslie, was born two years later, followed by a third daughter, Nina, in 1962. In 1957 he was promoted to Managing Editor at the paper’s New York headquarters. Events at the time such as the onset of the space race and the Civil Rights era urged Phillips and the Journal to take on news coverage of sociopolitical events in addition to its largely financial perspective, a decision that proved instrumental to the paper’s expansion.He became Executive Editor in 1965 and subsequently led Dow Jones’ expansion into global markets, including Asian and European editions of The Wall Street Journal, a partnership with the Associated Press to create an international news service, and agreements with various publishing companies in Japan, China, Singapore, and Malaysia. Phillips went on to become Vice President and Editorial Director in 1970, and finally President and CEO of Dow Jones two years later. In the early 70s, he also became involved in outside organizations such as the American Council on Education for Journalism (president 1971-73), the American Society of Newspaper Editors (president 1975-76) and the Pulitzer Prize Board (1977-1987).In 1972, he was part of a press delegation to the People’s Republic of China, the first since diplomatic relations were established following President Richard Nixon’s visit in February of that year. He met with Premier Zhou Enlai and regular Chinese citizens, producing some of the first articles on culture and policy to come from Western sources inside the PRC. Other international visits in the 1980s included trips to the Soviet Union and the Middle East. At home, he continued to promote the company’s growth and led efforts to promote equal opportunity for women, minorities and other marginalized groups at the Journal. Dow Jones became an early adopter of digital technologies, ranging from electronic news delivery to online editions.Warren Phillips retired from his duties at Dow Jones in 1991, to be succeeded by longtime colleague Peter Kann. He and his wife Barbara went on to found a publishing house, Bridge Works Publishing. In 2011, at the age of 85, he completed and published his autobiography, Newspaperman: Inside the News Business at The Wall Street Journal."
23,Osborn Elliott,"dean, Graduate School of Journalism",Columbia University,"[1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986]",,"""When I think of Oz Elliott, I think of a person who embodies all the qualities of a good citizen—a practical man of high ideals, a courageous man who exercises self-restraint, a worldly man who loves his city."" —David Dinkins, Newsweek, 09/27/08(Article courtesy of The New York Times.)Osborn Elliott, Father of Newsweek’s Rebirth, Dies at 83 By Michael T. KaufmanSeptember 28, 2008Osborn Elliott, the courtly editor who revitalized Newsweek magazine in the 1960s before he went on to serve as a $1-a-year deputy mayor in charge of economic development for a financially desperate New York City, died at his home in Manhattan on Sunday. He was 83. He died of complications of cancer, said his daughter Dorinda Elliott.When Mr. Elliott became Newsweek’s managing editor in 1959, the magazine lagged appreciably behind its chief competitor, Time, in circulation and advertising, and aped the sort of terse and idiosyncratic writing that Time had introduced. But Mr. Elliott, who rose to editor in 1961, was willing to experiment with formula and take a more ambitious journalistic path for Newsweek.The magazine began shunning the backward-running sentences that Time and its founder, Henry R. Luce, favored, and it started giving reporters bylines, breaking a long news magazine practice of anonymous writing. More substantively, it began producing in-depth polling on national issues. In cover articles, often to attract a younger readership, it examined the war in Vietnam and the mounting opposition to it, the civil rights movement, racial unrest in the cities, popular culture, and the counterculture. The perspectives were generally liberal, as had been the case from the beginning of Newsweek’s rivalry with Time, which generally reflected the conservative outlook of Mr. Luce.On Nov. 20, 1967, in a departure from its tradition of neutrality, Newsweek moved toward open advocacy with a 23-page section titled ‘The Negro in America: What Must Be Done.” In an editorial — the first in what was then the magazine’s 34-year history — Newsweek offered a 12-point program on how to accelerate the passage of black Americans into all aspects of society. The Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism recognized the series in giving Newsweek its Magazine of the Year Award.Newsweek also gave prominent coverage to the women’s movement — “Women in Revolt,” one cover said — though in 1970 the magazine itself was the subject of a federal discrimination complaint by 46 young women on its news staff, most of them hired as researchers to check facts, saying they had been denied writing positions because of their sex. Mr. Elliott, defending the magazine, said that most researchers were women because of a “news magazine tradition going back to almost 50 years.” In a negotiated agreement, the magazine promised to accelerate recruitment and promotion of women.During Mr. Elliott’s tenure, Newsweek’s circulation, which stood at almost 1.5 million in 1961, rose to more than 2.7 million by 1976, the year he left, though even then it still trailed Time by nearly a million readers. Mr. Elliott reveled in the job. “I had interviews with five presidents, audiences with two popes and the emperor of Japan,” he wrote in 1977, reflecting on his career in an article in The New York Times Magazine, adding that he had “spent the most interesting and moving week of my life living, and learning, in the black ghettos of America.”But he conceded that the pace in running the magazine was grueling and that he had promised himself to lessen his burden when men had landed on the moon. Thus, in 1969, he moved on to what he called the nonexistent job of editor in chief. He later had the titles of president, chief executive and board chairman.Mr. Elliott left Newsweek in 1976 to become New York’s first deputy mayor for economic development. The year before, at the urging of Senator Jacob K. Javits, he had formed and led the Citizens Committee for New York City, a private group founded to organize volunteers for projects the city could no longer afford to finance.The city was nearly bankrupt and had lost almost 650,000 jobs in the previous seven years. Its economic development administrator had resigned. Mayor Abraham D. Beame asked Mr. Elliott to take over the development agency and restructure it as the Office of Economic Opportunity. In taking the job at $1 a year, Mr. Elliott said a nominal salary would put him above the political process and give him more credibility with businesses. Charged with attracting businesses to the city, he shifted the emphasis from large corporations to smaller enterprises with fewer than 100 workers.His turn as a public servant was brief. In 1977, he resigned to become dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, a position he held until 1986, when he stepped down, although he stayed on as the George T. Delacorte Professor until 1994.With his liberal urban enthusiasms — he helped organize a Save Our Cities march on Washington in 1992 — his polka-dot bow ties and his conservatively cut suits, Mr. Elliott was a familiar, old-money figure in some of the city’s citadels of power: the Century Association, the Harvard Club, the Council of Foreign Relations and the board rooms of the New York Public Library and the Asia Society.The composer Lukas Foss, a friend, occasionally tutored him in his piano playing at Mr. Elliott’s Connecticut house. In 1983, his hospitable nature was exploited in a bizarre encounter that was to help inspire John Guare to write his award-winning play “Six Degrees of Separation.” An engaging young man had approached Mr. Elliot claiming to be the son of the actor Sidney Poitier and a classmate of one of Mr. Elliott’s daughters. When the young man said he had been mugged, Mr. Elliott invited him into his home and gave him money and clothes. It later turned out that the man was an imposter who had bilked other prominent New Yorkers.Osborn Elliott was born on Oct. 25, 1924, a descendant of Stephen Coerte van Voorhees, who came to New Amsterdam from Holland in the early 17th century. The boy grew up in a town house on East 62nd Street, where his parents, John Elliott, a stockbroker, and the former Audrey Osborn, a prominent real-estate broker who had campaigned for women’s suffrage, entertained friends like the columnist Walter Lippmann and the author John Gunther.Mr. Elliott attended the Browning School in New York, St. Paul’s School in Concord, N.H., and Harvard. In World War II, he saw combat in the Pacific aboard the heavy cruiser Boston. Discharged as a lieutenant, junior grade, in 1946, he considered pursuing a career in finance or following his elder brother, John, into advertising. (John, known as Jock, became chairman of Ogilvy & Mather. He died in 2005.) Instead, Mr. Elliott, who was known as Oz, chose journalism, joining The New York Journal of Commerce as a reporter. He had been working there for three years when his first wife, the former Deirdre Marie Spencer, who was working in the personnel department of Time, urged him to apply for a job with the magazine. He joined the staff as a contributing editor specializing in business and advanced to associate editor.In 1955, Newsweek, historically the weaker of the two weeklies, asked Mr. Elliott to be its business editor, and he took the job, beginning his long association with the magazine.In 1959 he published a book, “Men at the Top” (Harper), examining the qualities that had propelled executives to the upper ranks of corporations. In 1961, Philip L. Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post, bought controlling interest in Newsweek and promoted Mr. Elliott from managing editor to editor. He continued in the job when Katharine Graham assumed control after her husband’s death in 1963.Mr. Elliott’s first marriage ended in divorce in 1972. The following year he married the former Inger Abrahamsen McCabe, founder of China Seas, a fabric and carpeting importer. She survives him, as do three daughters by his first marriage, Diana Elliott Lidofsky of Providence, R.I.; Cynthia Elliott of Manhattan; and Dorinda, of Brooklyn; three stepchildren, Kari McCabe of Manhattan, Alexander McCabe of Brooklyn and Marit McCabe of Manhattan; 17 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. He is also survived by two foster sons, Samuel Wong of San Francisco and David Wong of St. Paul.“I was hooked on journalism,” Mr. Elliott wrote in his Times Magazine article, recalling his earliest days as a reporter and summing up his career. “Impressed by its demands for compression and clarity. Enchanted — mostly — by its practitioners and their often feigned cynicism. Flattered by the access it offered to heads of state, artists and tycoons. Infuriated by its imperfections — though as often as not, no doubt, blind to them as well. In love with its humor. Humbled, sort of, by its power.”"
24,"John Cowles, Jr.",president,Minneapolis Star and Tribune Company,"[1980, 1981, 1982]",,"John Cowles Jr., 82, Dies; Led Minneapolis Newspapersby Bruce WeberMarch 19, 2012, The New York TimesJohn Cowles Jr., a Minneapolis newspaper executive and philanthropist whose support for arts, sports and entertainment helped elevate the Twin Cities' cultural community to national prominence, died on Saturday at home in Minneapolis. He was 82.The cause was lung cancer, his son Jay said.Scion of a family that owned The Des Moines Register, started Look magazine and came to dominate the newspaper business in Minneapolis for more than half a century, Mr. Cowles (rhymes with bowls) succeeded his father in 1961 as the editor of two Minneapolis papers, the morning Tribune and the evening Star. He became president and chief executive of The Minneapolis Star and Tribune Company (later renamed Cowles Media Company) in 1968.His tenure was rocky, but during it the papers won praise for aggressive local reporting, increased arts and science coverage and support for the civil rights movement and the Equal Rights Amendment in editorials. (Though he was generally described as a progressive liberal, Mr. Cowles served on a White House committee in 1965 to generate support for President Johnson's war policies.)The company's fortunes declined in the late 1960s, however, after several unsuccessful acquisitions, including Harper's magazine and the publisher Harper & Row. In 1979, The Star and Tribune Company bought The Buffalo Courier-Express but was forced to close it three years later.In 1982, the company merged The Star and The Tribune and cut its work force, prompting the editor of the merged papers to quit in protest. Mr. Cowles subsequently fired the publisher and assumed the role himself. But just a few months later, in early 1983, the board of Cowles Media, which included his sister and two cousins, dismissed him as publisher and head of the company as well.He remained on the board until 1984 and into the 1990s continued to control a substantial percentage of company stock through his management of a family trust. Cowles Media was sold to the McClatchy Company in 1998.Beyond his turbulent stewardship of the newspapers, Mr. Cowles was known in Minneapolis and St. Paul for his philanthropy and his belief that arts institutions and sports teams were necessary for cities to grow and thrive. In 1960, he served on a steering committee -- and by most accounts was its leading voice -- that persuaded the British director Tyrone Guthrie to establish a resident theater company in Minneapolis to perform classic works in repertory. He then helped raise $2.2 million, and the Guthrie Theater opened in 1963 with a production of ""Hamlet."" It became a model for nonprofit theaters across the country. Four decades later, he was co-chairman of the architecture committee for the new Guthrie Theater that opened in 2006.In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Mr. Cowles was active in the construction of the Metrodome, a state-financed domed stadium in downtown Minneapolis for the city's two major sports franchises, the Minnesota Twins and the Minnesota Vikings.His position on the project was controversial. Opponents, including staff members at The Minneapolis Tribune, thought it was a clear conflict of interest for the owner of a newspaper to take a public position on an important local issue it was covering. In 1979, staff members placed an ad in their own paper disassociating themselves from the company's involvement.The Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome opened in 1982; the Twins have since moved to Target Field.Mr. Cowles said in a 2010 interview that the impetus for his support of the Guthrie and the Metrodome were the same.""Strengthening the cultural organization and life of the Twin Cities was not only going to make life more interesting and attractive for our families,""  he said, ""but was going to attract business and keep business here in town, and it was going to be just plain good business.""Mr. Cowles was born on May 27, 1929, in Des Moines, Iowa, where his grandfather, Gardner Cowles, had been publisher of The Des Moines Register since 1903. His father, John, and his uncle Gardner Cowles Jr., known as Mike, founded Look magazine. John Cowles Sr. bought The Minneapolis Star in 1935 and moved his family to Minneapolis in 1938.The next year, the family business bought The Minneapolis Journal and merged it with The Star, and then added The Minneapolis Tribune in 1941. Young John graduated from the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and Harvard, and spent two years in the Army before joining the family business as a reporter.After his dismissal from the company in 1983, Mr. Cowles began a somewhat eclectic career. He studied agricultural economics, taught aerobics, toured in the United States and Europe with a modern dance company, and helped establish a women's professional fast-pitch softball league.

26,William J. Raspberry,columnist,The Washington Post,"[1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986]",,"(Courtesy of The Washington Post)William Raspberry dies at 76: Washington Post columnist wrote about social issues including race, povertyBy Matt SchudelJuly 17, 2012William Raspberry, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The Washington Post whose fiercely independent views illuminated conflicts concerning education, poverty, crime and race, and who was one of the first black journalists to gain a wide following in the mainstream press, died July 17 at his home in Washington. He was 76.He had prostate cancer, said his wife, Sondra Raspberry.Mr. Raspberry wrote an opinion column for The Post for nearly 40 years before retiring in 2005. More than 200 newspapers carried his syndicated columns, which were filtered through the prism of his experience growing up in the segregated South.His writings were often provocative but seldom predictable. Although he considered himself a liberal, Mr. Raspberry often bucked many of the prevailing pieties of liberal orthodoxy. He favored integration but opposed busing children to achieve racial balance. He supported gun control but — during a time when the District seemed to be a free-fire zone for drug sellers — he could understand the impulse to shoot back.When strident voices were shouting for attention, Mr. Raspberry often favored a moderate tone. He did not consider himself a political partisan and even stopped appearing on argumentative news-talk shows because, as he said in 2006, “they force you to pretend to be mad even when you’re not.”Instead of following other pundits to Capitol Hill, Mr. Raspberry looked at another side of Washington: the problems facing ordinary people, sometimes voiced through an imaginary D.C. cabdriver — simply called “the cabbie” — who was a recurring figure in his columns.“From the day Bill Raspberry wrote his first Post column, his advice was as wise and his voice as clear as anyone’s in Washington,” Donald E. Graham, chairman of The Washington Post Co., said in an interview. “To the city, Bill’s columns brought 40 years of smart, independent judgment.”Mr. Raspberry stood slightly apart from the civil rights movement of the 1960s, which he viewed not as a participant but from the detached perspective of a reporter. Because his views did not always conform to his readers’ expectations, he received pointed criticism from the right and the left.“He was viewed as a truth-teller,” Vernon E. Jordan Jr., a lawyer, civil rights advocate and political adviser, said in an interview. “I am sure that I disagreed with him on a number of things. He had a way of telling you to go to hell and making you look forward to the trip.”Mr. Raspberry derived some of his core principles from a bedrock belief in self-reliance and the importance of education. He often cited the example of his parents, both of whom were teachers. He challenged prominent civil rights figures to put their words into action to help build a better world for the poor and disenfranchised.“Education is the one best hope black Americans have for a decent future,” Mr. Raspberry wrote in a 1982 column. “The civil rights leadership, for all its emphasis on desegregating schools, has done very little to improve them.”Anger at the forces that caused racism was fine, Mr. Raspberry argued, but anger in itself did not solve problems. Recalling his own childhood in Mississippi, he recognized that children could thrive even when poverty was just beyond the window.“It’s not racism that’s keeping our children from learning, it’s something much nearer home than that,” he told Washingtonian magazine in 2003. “We need to remember that the most influential resource a child can have is a parent who cares. And we need to admit that sometimes parents are the missing ingredient.”When Mr. Raspberry began writing a column on local matters for The Post in 1966, the only nationally syndicated black columnist in the general press was Carl T. Rowan. In 1970, Mr. Raspberry’s column moved to the paper’s op-ed page.“Bill Raspberry inspired a rising generation of African American columnists and commentators who followed in his path, including me,” Clarence Page, a Pulitzer-winning columnist with the Chicago Tribune, told The Post. He added that Mr. Raspberry and Rowan “blazed a trail for the rest of us, not only as journalists but as voices of courage against the narrow ideologies of the left or right.”As a columnist, Mr. Raspberry disagreed with the journalistic credo of “cynical coldheartedness masquerading as objectivity,” he told Editor & Publisher magazine in 1994. Instead, he believed members of the press could “care about the people they report on and still retain the capacity to tell the story straight.”When Mr. Raspberry won the Pulitzer for commentary in 1994, he was the second African American columnist to achieve the honor. (Page was the first, in 1989.) Mr. Raspberry’s Pulitzer-winning columns covered a range of topics, from female genital mutilation in Africa to urban violence, to musings on the legacies of civil rights leaders.Mr. Raspberry drew analogies between Somalia, where U.S. troops were deployed at the time, and violent sections of the District, where — as in Mogadishu — heavily armed young men in fast vehicles controlled vast stretches of the city.“How different are parts of Somalia from parts of the United States?” he wrote. “And how much more like Somalia would the United States become if the gun-rights people have their way?”In another column, Mr. Raspberry appeared, at first glance, to deliver a rant about hip-hop music. But he made an unexpected turn, showing how tastes in music reflected the changing realities of young people’s lives.“My children . . . easily tick off four, five, six friends who have died in the past few years,” he wrote. “Three were homicides — shot down either over drugs or over some offense that would have cost a member of my generation a bloody nose at most.“ . . . And we worry about song lyrics?”William James Raspberry was born Oct. 12, 1935, in the northeastern Mississippi town of Okolona. He was one of five children of James and Willie Mae Raspberry. His father taught shop and his mother taught English at a high school and a two-year college for African American students. He often cited his parents and the small academy in Okolona as crucial influences on his life.“I grew up in apartheid,” he told the News & Record of Greensboro, N.C., in 1996. “And yet it never induced my parents to teach us anything else than that we were responsible for our own behavior, for our own minds.”Mr. Raspberry left Mississippi to attend Indiana Central College (now the University of Indianapolis). In college, he worked at the Indianapolis Recorder, a weekly newspaper geared toward black audiences.After graduating in 1958, he served as a public information officer with the Army. In 1962, Mr. Raspberry was hired as a Teletype operator by The Post. Within months, he began working as one of the first black reporters for the newspaper’s Metro desk.Seeking a way to stand out, he recalled in a 2005 interview with NPR, “I started asking myself, ‘What is it I know that the other guys don’t know? What am I better at?’ And my thought was that I’ve had a couple decades being black, and they haven’t.”Mr. Raspberry made a name for himself in 1965, when The Post dispatched him to cover riots in the Watts section of Los Angeles. A year later, he was a columnist.After the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, Mr. Raspberry wrote a series of dispatches from the strife-torn streets of Washington, chronicling a city on fire.Mr. Raspberry was known as a careful monitor of racial politics, but some readers were incensed in 1990, when he appeared to voice grudging respect for the polarizing Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. A year earlier, Mr. Raspberry had excoriated what he called the “gratuitous antisemitism” of Farrakhan and some of his supporters.“Blacks in particular are at pains to force America to face up to racism, blatant and subtle, and to demand that others be sensitive to our special concerns,” Mr. Raspberry wrote. “Is it too much to suggest that those who demand sensitivity have a duty to practice it?”Survivors include Mr. Raspberry’s wife of 45 years, Sondra Dodson Raspberry of Washington; three children, Patricia D. Raspberry and Mark J. Raspberry, both of Washington, and Angela Raspberry Jackson of Detroit; a foster son, Reginald Harrison of Manassas; his 106-year-old mother, Willie Mae Tucker Raspberry of Indianapolis; a sister; and a brother.Mr. Raspberry taught journalism for more than 10 years at Duke University and received more than 15 honorary doctorates. A collection of his columns, “Looking Backward at Us,” was published in 1991, and he received awards from the National Press Club and the National Association of Black Journalists.In retirement, Mr. Raspberry devoted much of his time to an educational foundation, Baby Steps, that he organized in his hometown in Mississippi. He funded the project for low-income parents and children from his own pocket.After writing more than 5,000 opinion columns, Mr. Raspberry said in a speech at the University of Virginia in 2006, he had learned two important lessons.The first, he said, “is that in virtually every public controversy, most thoughtful people secretly believe both sides.”“The second, which has kept my confidence from turning into arrogance, is that it is entirely possible for you to disagree with me without being, on that account, either a scoundrel or a fool.”"

Wilkins attended the University of Michigan, receiving his B.A. in 1953 and his J.D. in 1956, interning with Thurgood Marshall at the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund. Following graduation, Wilkins worked in several capacities as an advocate for justice. Beginning his career as a caseworker in the Ohio Welfare Department, Wilkins went on to work for the U.S. Agency for International Development and then as assistant attorney general under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Wilkins' interest in legal issues and equality stems partially from his family's background. His uncle, Roy Wilkins, was executive secretary of the NAACP from 1955 to 1977. In 1972, Wilkins began writing for the editorial page of The Washington Post just as the Watergate scandal was breaking. His critically informed editorials about the issues leading up to President Richard Nixon's resignation won him a shared Pulitzer Prize, along with reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and cartoonist Herb Block. He then moved to The New York Times, where he served as the first African American on its editorial board as well as a columnist. Subsequently, Wilkins worked for the Institute for Policy Studies, The Washington Star, National Public Radio and CBS Radio. He continues to be a major commentator and analyst on American public policy and social justice issues.Roger Wilkins retired from teaching at George Mason University in 2007."

31,David A. Laventhol,"president, Times Mirror Company","and publisher and chief executive officer, Los Angeles Times","[1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991]",,"(Courtesy of The New York Times)David Laventhol, Publisher on Both Coasts, Dies at 81By Dennis HevesiApril 9, 2015David A. Laventhol, a former publisher of The Los Angeles Times and Newsday who made a journalistically acclaimed but financially doomed attempt to break into the New York City newspaper market by starting New York Newsday in 1985, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 81.The cause was complications of Parkinson’s disease, his son, Peter, said.In a 41-year career that took him from beat reporter at The St. Petersburg Times in Florida to assistant managing editor of The Washington Post and eventually to the top tiers of two more of the nation’s most respected newspapers, Mr. Laventhol brought to the daily editors’ conference a keen and unconventional sense of what could be a story. Mr. Laventhol joined The Washington Post in 1966 as night managing editor. Two years later the newspaper’s executive editor, Ben Bradlee, asked him to restructure The Post’s For and About Women section, noted for its coverage of formal teas and its etiquette columns. With an emphasis on vibrant writing, the new section, Style, delved into the way ordinary people led their lives, particularly during their off hours. Within a year of starting Style, Mr. Laventhol accepted an offer from Bill Moyers, who was then the publisher of Newsday, the Long Island daily, to become its associate editor. Mr. Laventhol soon began designing Part II, Newsday’s counterpart to The Post’s Style section. By 1970, Mr. Laventhol had been promoted to executive editor of Newsday. That same year the paper’s owner, Harry F. Guggenheim, sold Newsday to the Times Mirror Company, which then owned The Los Angeles Times. Mr. Laventhol was Newsday’s executive editor from 1970 to 1978, the year he was named publisher and chief executive officer. In 1972 Newsday, which had been publishing six days a week, added a Sunday edition. With the closing of The Long Island Press, and hoping to nudge The Daily News from the semi-suburban environs of northeast Queens, Mr. Laventhol started Newsday’s Queens edition in 1977. Two years later he opened Newsday’s first foreign bureau, in China; bureaus in London, Cairo and Mexico City followed. Under Mr. Laventhol’s leadership, Newsday won four Pulitzer Prizes, including one for a 1974 series called “The Heroin Trail,” which traced the flow of drugs from the poppy fields of Turkey to the streets of Long Island, and another, in 1985, for its coverage of famine in Africa. New York Newsday won critical praise for its attempt to mix the entertaining elements of old-style tabloids with in-depth news coverage. But in 1995, after losing an estimated $100 million, it ceased publication. “It was the only time I ever cried in this business,” Mr. Laventhol said in an interview. By then, he had risen to the top ranks of Times Mirror. In 1981, while still publisher of Newsday, he was also named the company’s vice president for Eastern newspapers. By 1987, he was president of Times Mirror; three years later, he was publisher of The Los Angeles Times. During Mr. Laventhol’s time in that post, the paper added correspondents in Berlin, Brussels and Tokyo and opened a Seattle bureau. After the riots following the 1992 acquittal of four white police officers charged with beating a black motorist, Rodney King, Mr. Laventhol started a Sunday section covering Los Angeles’s inner city. He also started a Spanish-language tabloid. Among the three Pulitzers The Times received during Mr. Laventhol’s tenure as publisher, one was for its coverage of the 1992 riots. The inner-city edition was closed several years after Mr. Laventhol retired as publisher in 1993, after he was found to have Parkinson’s disease. David Abram Laventhol was born in Philadelphia on July 15, 1933, the son of Jesse and Clare Laventhol. His father was a political reporter for The Philadelphia Record. At Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington, Mr. Laventhol edited the school newspaper while also working as a copy boy at The Washington Star. In 1953, after working at The Yale Daily News, he joined the Army and spent two years repairing radios. He returned to Yale, graduated in 1957, and was hired by The St. Petersburg Times. Two years later, while on leave from the paper, he earned a master’s degree at the University of Minnesota. In 1960, he returned to St. Petersburg and became national news editor. The New York Herald Tribune hired him as city editor in 1963, and three years later The Washington Post asked him to become night managing editor. Mr. Laventhol married Esther Coons in 1957. Besides his wife and son, survivors include a daughter, Sarah Laventhol. For nine years, starting in 1982, Mr. Laventhol was a member of the Pulitzer Prize board, serving as its chairman in 1988 and 1989. At an annual salary of $1, he was publisher and editor of The Columbia Journalism Review from 1999 to 2003. He also served as a director of the United Negro College Fund and chairman of the Committee to Protect Journalists. When, in 1986, Mr. Laventhol chose someone who was not a journalist by training to succeed him as publisher of Newsday, he felt it necessary to leave his successor a memo. It read, in part: “Journalists are moralists. They’re primarily in the business to make a better world, to improve society through revelations of its sins and glories.” Correction: April 15, 2015 An obituary in some editions on Thursday and Friday about the newspaper publisher David Laventhol referred incorrectly to his tenure as chairman of the Pulitzer Prize board. He held that position for one term, 1988-89 — not in 1988 and in 1999."

33,Katherine Fanning,editor and publisher,Anchorage (Alaska) Daily News,[1983],,"Katherine W. Fanning, 73; Pioneering Newspaper EditorBy Edward WongOctober 23, 2000Katherine W. Fanning, a former owner of The Anchorage Daily News who later was editor of The Christian Science Monitor, died on Thursday. She was 73.Ms. Fanning died of colon cancer at her Boston home, where she lived with her husband and was writing a book about her years in Alaska. She was regarded as a pioneer in journalism, especially because she worked at a time when few women held positions of power in the industry.Under her ownership, the Daily News fought its way to a circulation of 50,000 from 12,000, becoming Alaska's largest newspaper. Along the way, it won a Pulitzer Prize for public service for a 15-part series on the powerful Teamsters union in Alaska.The newspaper also took liberal stands on gun control, environmental issues and the land rights of Alaskan natives, earning it the enmity of the business establishment.Nothing in Ms. Fanning's childhood and early married life hinted that she would, at nearly 40, reinvent herself as a risk-taking journalist.She was born on Oct. 18, 1927, in Joliet, Ill. The only child of a bank president, she went to private schools, made her debut at a tea dance in 1945 and graduated from Smith College in 1949. That year, she met Marshall Field IV, a multimillionaire whose family owned a department store chain and published The Chicago Sun-Times.She once credited that marriage as her introduction to and informal education in journalism, but never considered working in the field until much later. While her husband ran the business, she volunteered with charities. Society columnists called her ''the Grace Kelly of Chicago.''But in 1963, Ms. Fanning and her husband divorced because of what she later called her discontent with the high-society lifestyle. She joined the Christian Science church. Then in 1965, she piled her three children into a Buick station wagon and drove north on the Alaska Highway.''After the divorce, my life was on a downhill slide,'' she told a writer for Town & Country in 1986. ''I needed to grab onto something solid and permanent.''She found that in the rugged land of Alaska.At the end of their road trip, the family settled in Anchorage. The Daily News, an eight-page tabloid that was then overshadowed by The Anchorage Times, hired Ms. Fanning to organize its library for $2 an hour. She quickly moved up through the ranks to become a reporter whose byline appeared frequently on the front page.In 1966, she married Larry Fanning, who had been editor of The Chicago Sun-Times. He had gone to Alaska to help Ms. Fanning sell her house but became enamored with the state. The two bought the Daily News in 1967. The newspaper began running investigative stories that riled the corporate establishment. Many businesses refused to advertise in the newspaper.Mr. Fanning died at his desk of a heart attack in 1971. His wife became the sole editor and publisher, and kept up the newspaper's crusading efforts. Under her tenure, and with large infusions of money from Ted Field, the Hollywood financier who is Ms. Fanning's son from her first marriage, the newspaper continued to thrive. It received the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1976 for its series on the Teamsters.In 1983, Ms. Fanning moved to Boston to become editor of The Christian Science Monitor. She married Amos Mathews around the same time. During her five years at The Monitor, she was credited with building up its news coverage. But in 1988, she and two other top editors resigned over budget cuts imposed by the church.After she left The Monitor, Ms. Fanning spent a year at the Institute of Politics at Harvard. She then taught classes as an adjunct professor at Boston University until 1993.While living in Boston, Ms. Fanning also held influential positions at several news organizations. She became the first woman president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, and she joined the board of directors of The Boston Globe Newspaper Company in 1992. From 1988 to 1989, she sat on the board of directors of The Associated Press.Ms. Fanning is survived by her husband and three children: Mr. Field of Los Angeles, Katherine Stephen of Washington, D.C., and Barbara Field of Boston."

36,Eugene L. Roberts,former executive editor and senior vice president,The Philadelphia Inquirer,"[1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991]",,"(Courtesty of the Pennsylvania Center for the Book)Gene Roberts, a former executive editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer, achieved national fame for leading the paper to 17 Pulitzer Prizes in an 18-year span. He was widely respected for his high standards in journalism and ability to run a newspaper. A former reporter of his once said, “He’s the ideal editor that a reporter dreams about.”Eugene Leslie Roberts Jr. was born on June 15, 1932, in Pikeville, North Carolina, to an area preacher, Eugene L. Roberts Sr., and Margaret (Ham) Roberts. While growing up in Goldsboro, North Carolina, Roberts’s interest in journalism began to grow. It started when Roberts helped his father print a small weekly paper that was distributed to the local community. This interest extended through his teens and into his college years. He attended Mars Hill College from 1950 to 1952 before graduating from the University of North Carolina with a degree in journalism in 1954. After college, Roberts enlisted in the military and served in the U.S. Army under the Counter-Intelligence Corps from 1954 to 1956.After returning home from the Army, Roberts earned his first official newspaper job working for his home-town paper, Goldsboro News-Argus. At the time, it was the leading newspaper in Wayne County, North Carolina. His duties included writing for its farm column, “Rambling in Rural Wayne,” and reporting on the local government. Later in his life, Roberts recalled the column, saying that he covered “the first farmer of the season to transplant tobacco plants from the seed bed to the field” and “a sweet potato that looked like Gen. Charles de Gaulle.”Roberts moved on to work for the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot (1958 to 1959) and Raleigh News & Observer (1959 to 1961) before being selected for a Nieman Fellowship by Harvard University in 1962. The Nieman Fellowship is a prestigious 10-month appointment at Harvard University for reporters, editors, photographers, editorial writers, and cartoonists with at least five years of full-time professional experience in news media. According to Harvard’s Nieman Foundation for Journalism, fellows use this time “to step back from deadlines, to renew their intellectual curiosity and to enrich their understanding of the worlds they cover as journalists.” As a result, Roberts spent his time at Harvard preparing a book with fellow Nieman award winner, Jack Nelson, called The Censors and the Schools (1963).After spending time at Harvard, Roberts returned to the Goldsboro News-Argus and worked as its Sunday editor from 1962 to 1963. He then spent one year with the Detroit Free Press covering labor (1963 to 1964) and then one year as its city editor (1964 to 1965). In 1965, Roberts was one of the most promising young journalists in America. His hard work was not overlooked, as he was spotted by The New York Times. In 1965, they offered him a job as a chief Southern correspondent. Roberts accepted the position and spent two years covering many of the trials and tribulations of the Civil Rights Movement. When the Vietnam War started heating up, Roberts was quickly sent to South Vietnam in 1968. Once there, Roberts encountered a soldier who recognized his column from the Goldsboro News-Argus. Taken aback by the man, Roberts later wrote, “I learned never to underestimate readers. They can laugh with you at the Charles de Gaulle sweet potato stories, but they expect depth when stories arise that are important to them.”When Roberts returned to the U.S., The Times named him its national editor in 1969. He stayed there until 1972, when the Philadelphia Inquirer came knocking on his door. The paper was losing money and its journalistic qualities were coming into question. The Inquirer sought out someone who could bring energy and uphold high standards of journalism. Roberts was the perfect fit. He was hired as its new executive editor and change was immediate. With Roberts at the helm, The Inquirer tackled various local, national, and international issues. Topics varied from Pentagon spending to mental hospitals to South Africa. Stories such as these earned the respect from other journalists and newspapers across the country. The hard work paid off as the paper earned 17 Pulitzer Prizes in an 18-year span.In a stunning change of events, Roberts announced his decision to leave The Inquirer at a noon meeting in 1990. Surprising most of his staff with the decision, Roberts became so emotional during his announcement that he left the meeting early. After numerous confrontations over budget cuts, Roberts finally had enough and resented an industry obsessed with profit margins. Hearing of Roberts’s resignation, Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation, said, “Gene Roberts or persons like him were the kind of people that Jefferson and Madison and George Mason had in mind when they carved out the role of journalists in a self-governing society.” Roberts was known to say, “I didn’t want to work for another newspaper. This is my newspaper.”Roberts kept his distance from newspapers by accepting a teaching job at the University of Maryland in 1991. In 1993, he received the National Press Club’s “Fourth Estate Award” as a tribute to his lifetime of achievements in journalism. After a few years of teaching journalism classes, Roberts was persuaded by friend and executive editor of The New York Times, Joe Lelyveld, to become managing editor of The Times in 1994. Roberts took a three year leave of absence from Maryland in order to help a newspaper find its old identity. According to some at the time the newspaper was “socially rigid and out of step with the mood, views, and concerns of New Yorkers.” Although Roberts was at The Times for only a few years, he reverted to the hard-nosed journalistic approach. By allowing journalists to take their time to find and write a good story rather than just write about the sensational, The Times produced several well-written stories and gained back some of its credibility. Roberts returned to the University of Maryland in 1997.In 2007, Roberts, along with Hank Klibanoff, authored a book entitled The Race Beat: The Press, the Civil Rights Struggle, and the Awakening of a Nation, which explores how America’s press system has evolved over time, going from ignoring race issues to realizing the importance of the 1950s and 1960s civil rights movement. Vanessa Bush, a Booklist contributor, wrote that Klibanoff and Roberts ""demonstrate the profound changes the movement wrought not only on U.S. social justice but also on American journalism."" Other reviewers in addition to Bush have applauded the Roberts and Klibanoff for how they recognize the black journalists and editors who had been historically ignored and gone unnoticed. In 2007, Klibanoff and Roberts won the Pulitzer Prize for this book.Roberts currently lives in the Washington, D.C. area with his wife Susan and continues to teach journalism at the University of Maryland. Together Roberts and Susan have raised four children: Leslie Jane, Margaret Page, Elizabeth Susan, and Polly Ann. Roberts teaches classes on writing complex stories, newsroom management, and the press’ role in the Civil Rights Movement. He enjoys his time away from the news field saying, “Four months off at the end of spring. Four to six weeks off during the Christmas holiday...that wouldn’t have been possible if I were still in the newspaper business.” Roberts also served as the American chairman of both the International Press Institute and the Committee to Protect Journalists. He is a former chairman of the Pulitzer Board for awards in journalism and arts and letters."
37,C.K. McClatchy,editor and chairman of the board,McClatchy Newspapers,"[1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988]",,"(Courtesy of the Los Angeles Times)C.K. McClatchy, 62; Head of Chain of NewspapersBy Edward J. BoyerApril 17, 1989C.K. McClatchy, chairman of the McClatchy chain of newspapers in California, Washington state and Alaska, died Sunday after collapsing while jogging in Sacramento.A soft-spoken man known for his abiding independence, McClatchy, 62, was jogging in William Land Park, near a school bearing his family's name, when he apparently suffered a heart attack, said McClatchy Newspapers President Erwin Potts.""He was just a great friend and a great boss,"" said Potts, who knew McClatchy for 13 years. ""He was a hell of a newspaperman and he was a hell of a guy. We're just going to miss him an awful lot.""McClatchy, who Potts said had no history of heart problems, was pronounced dead shortly after 1 p.m. at the University of California, Davis, Medical Center in Sacramento.McClatchy Newspapers publishes the Sacramento Bee and 11 other West Coast newspapers. The Anchorage Daily News, one of the company's papers, won the Pulitzer Prize for public service last month.""If you had to draw up a list of people most important to journalism in this country, you'd come to C.K. pretty early in the game,"" said Riverside Press-Enterprise Publisher Tim Hayes, a longtime McClatchy friend.""I was most struck by his independence,"" Hayes said. ""There's so little independence left in this profession. He was a wonderful guy without any pretense.""Los Angeles Times Publisher and Chief Executive Officer Tom Johnson described McClatchy as a ""splendid newspaper leader who represented the very highest standards of editorial and managerial excellence.""""He was uncommonly dedicated to quality in his newspapers. His passing is a major loss to our profession.""McClatchy's family has been a powerful force in Sacramento since 1857, when C.K. McClatchy's great-grandfather, James McClatchy, served as the first editor of the Sacramento Bee. He later bought the newspaper.C.K. (for Charles Kenny) McClatchy was born in Fresno on March 25, 1927, and earned a bachelor's degree from Stanford University in 1950. He began his career as a reporter for the Washington Post in 1953, and moved to the Sacramento Bee five years later.He held several editorial and managerial posts at the Bee and with the parent company, and was elected chairman of the board when McClatchy Newspapers stock was offered for sale to the public last year.At about the same time the company began offering its shares on the American Stock Exchange, McClatchy accused some newspaper chains of paying more attention to profits than to quality journalism.Delivering the annual Press-Enterprise Lecture at UC Riverside, McClatchy pointedly criticized several newspaper groups, saying Rupert Murdoch's News America Co., then owner of the New York Post, ""deserves mention in any listing of the appalling.""""He was saying we should talk candidly about the problems associated with group or chain ownership,"" said the Press-Enterprise's Hayes. ""Groups should criticize each other and look at the problems--the sameness of papers in a chain, excessive rotation of editors. Nobody is in your town for more than three or four years.""McClatchy's great-grandfather came to California during the 1849 Gold Rush and sent dispatches to several newspapers, including Horace Greeley's New York Tribune. As the Bee's editor, he proved to be a forceful environmentalist, arguing against hydraulic mining.The process ruined the environment, poured debris into the rivers and harmed farmers, James McClatchy argued. When he died in 1883, he was succeeded by C.K. McClatchy, a champion of the state's progressive movement, ally of reform Gov. Hiram Johnson and a foe of the Southern Pacific Railroad's grip on state government.The elder C.K., who died in 1936, was succeeded by his daughter, Eleanor, who left Columbia University to run the company for the next 42 years. She, in turn, was followed by McClatchy, her nephew, and C.K.'s grandson.The papers were characterized by their liberal editorial point of view, and McClatchy's endorsement was vigorously sought by Democratic Party candidates.McClatchy had autographed photos of John F. Kennedy, Adlai Stevenson, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Earl Warren in his office. He worked as Stevenson's press secretary during the former Illinois governor's 1956 presidential campaign.McClatchy's independence and courage made the newspaper company willing ""to take on big, tough and potentially dangerous subjects, and to risk and fight through the litigation that this inevitably brings,"" former Sacramento Bee executive editor Frank McCulloch told The Times in a 1987 interview.The newspapers once had seven libel suits pending simultaneously in Fresno County alone, McCulloch said.Nevada Sen. Paul Laxalt once sued the chain's Bee newspapers for $250 million, charging that he had been libeled in a story saying profits had been skimmed from a gambling casino he once owned. Laxalt and the papers settled the suit before trial, and both sides claimed victory.""He can put whatever label on it he wants to, but the fact is he has dismissed (the suit) without (receiving) any apology, without any retraction and without any payment of money (for damages),"" McClatchy said of Laxalt.The newspapers' insurance carrier later paid Laxalt's lawyers $647,454 for their work in the unsuccessful suit.Along with the Sacramento Bee and the Anchorage Daily News, McClatchy Newspapers publishes the Fresno Bee and Modesto Bee, the Tacoma News Tribune and Tri-City Herald in Washington state and several weekly newspapers.At the time of McClatchy's death, he was a member of the Pulitzer Prize board, the Newspaper Advertising Board of Directors, a trustee of the Washington Journalism Center in Washington, D.C., and a member of the executive committee of the American Press Institute.McClatchy is survived by two sons, Charles, 30, of Phoenix, Ariz., and Kevin, 26, of Miami; a daughter, Adair, 28, of San Francisco; two brothers, James, 58, of Tiburon, and Ellery, 64, of Palm Beach, Fla., and his mother, Phebe, of Fresno.Funeral arrangements were pending."

From that time on, he and his mother and one of his sisters moved frequently, living in Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey. After graduating from Johns Hopkins University in 1947, Baker worked as a journalist for the Baltimore Sun (1947–54). He also wrote a lively weekly column, “From a Window on Fleet Street.” At the Washington bureau of the New York Times (1954–62), he covered the White House, the State Department, and the Congress. In the early 1960s he began writing the “Observer” column on the paper’s editorial page. In this syndicated humour column he initially concentrated on political satire, writing about the administrations of U.S. Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard M. Nixon. Moving to New York City in 1974, he found other subjects to skewer, and in 1979 he won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary. His topics included tax reform, the artist Norman Rockwell, inflation, and fear.Baker’s Growing Up (1982), which recalls his peripatetic childhood, won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for biography. A sequel, The Good Times, was published in 1989. Baker’s other works include An American in Washington (1961), No Cause for Panic (1964), Poor Russell’s Almanac (1972), and further collections of his columns. Baker also edited The Norton Book of Light Verse (1986) and wrote the book for the musical play Home Again, Home Again (1979). In 1993 he succeeded Alistair Cooke as host of the television program Masterpiece Theatre. In that same year he published Russell Baker’s Book of American Humor, which, following an illuminating introduction, gives its due to figures such as Benjamin Franklin, Mark Twain, and James Thurber. Baker’s final “Observer” column for the New York Times appeared on Christmas Day, 1998. In 2002 he published Looking Back: Heroes, Rascals, and Other Icons of the American Imagination."
40,Claude F. Sitton,"senior lecturer, Emory University","former editor and vice president, The News and Observer","[1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994]",,"(Courtesy of The New York Times)Claude Sitton, 89, Acclaimed Civil Rights Reporter, DiesBy Dennis HevesiMarch 10, 2015Claude Sitton, a son of the South whose unwavering coverage of the civil rights movement for The New York Times through most of that tumultuous era was hailed as a benchmark of 20th-century journalism, died on Tuesday in Atlanta. He was 89.The cause was congestive heart failure, his son Clint said. Mr. Sitton had been in a hospice.In later years Mr. Sitton won a Pulitzer Prize as a columnist for The News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C., where he was also the editor. But it was in the crucible of the Jim Crow South that he forged his most enduring legacy.Roaming the region as a reporter from May 1958 to October 1964, Mr. Sitton was an eyewitness to one of the most wrenching but consequential episodes in American history, often spending weeks on the road, flying home to Atlanta for a night, then heading out again the next day.By the end of those six and a half years he had written almost 900 articles, some analytical and steeped in his knowledge of the South, many drawn from on-the-scene reporting.They recounted the strategizing by civil rights leaders in the courts and on the ground, explored the political dynamics of race in the statehouses and at the White House, and opened readers’ eyes to the violence with which the movement was often met — the beatings, bombings and church burnings.He often portrayed the struggle through the individuals who gave it flesh: the demonstrators, freedom riders and ordinary Southern blacks who braved white mobs, brutal police officers and segregationist public officials simply to get an education or to vote.When Turner Catledge, the Mississippi-born managing editor of The Times, chose Mr. Sitton to cover the South in 1958, “he was about to set in motion a level of reporting that would establish the national standard for two decades,” Gene Roberts and Hank Klibanoff wrote in 2006 in their Pulitzer Prize-winning book, “The Race Beat: The Press, the Civil Rights Struggle and the Awakening of a Nation.” (Mr. Roberts was himself a managing editor of The Times.)“Nobody in the news business,” the authors continued, “would have as much impact as he would — on the reporting of the civil rights movement, on the federal government’s response, or on the movement itself. Sitton’s byline would be atop the stories that landed on the desks of three presidents.”One of his articles, in 1962, caught the attention of Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general at the time. It described a south Georgia sheriff and his deputies intruding on a voting rights meeting at a church in Terrell County and menacing the citizens there. One officer repeatedly struck his palm with a large flashlight as if it were a club; another ran his hand over his revolver and cartridge belt.Mr. Sitton began by quoting the sheriff: “We want our colored people to go on living like they have for the last hundred years.”Kennedy sent a Justice Department team to Terrell County to sue the sheriff two weeks later.“It was not that Claude was some flaming liberal or liberator,” Mr. Klibanoff told The Associated Press in an interview. “He just liked a good story and liked to have it first. And frequently he was reporting on injustice — and they knew, on the civil rights side, that if The New York Times wrote about it, it would get attention from important people.”Mr. Sitton covered the Little Rock school desegregation upheaval in 1958-59, after Gov. Orval E. Faubus of Arkansas ordered the city’s schools closed. He was there on June 11, 1963, when Gov. George C. Wallace fulfilled his campaign pledge to “stand in the schoolhouse door” before stepping aside when handed a presidential order to allow two black students to enroll at the University of Alabama.And he was on the first bus carrying Freedom Riders out of Montgomery, Ala., on May 24, 1961, as it headed toward Jackson, Miss.That bus trip was a three-day exception he had been granted after being barred from setting foot in Alabama — not by Alabama officials but, to his intense frustration, by the Times’s lawyers and top editors. The order was a cautionary response to two libel lawsuits that had been brought by Alabama officials (neither involving Mr. Sitton).The Times eventually won both cases, one of them eliciting a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in Times v. Sullivan, setting the precedent that public officials cannot receive damages for criticism of their official performance unless they can prove actual malice.Only after Governor Wallace was elected in November 1962 and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. declared Birmingham a new focus of the civil rights struggle was Mr. Sitton allowed to step again on Alabama soil after two and a half years. But there was no dearth of news elsewhere in the South.He was in Oxford, Miss., on Sept. 30, 1962, when James H. Meredith, a black Air Force veteran, was admitted to the University of Mississippi. He wrote of the all-night riots on campus in which two people were killed.After Medgar Evers, another civil rights leader, was shot to death outside his home in Jackson on June 12, 1963, enraged demonstrators took to the city’s streets. The next day, Mr. Sitton’s article on the front page of The Times described how police officers had charged demonstrators who were chanting “We want freedom!” and clubbed them into submission.“Six Negroes were struck or choked by police nightsticks drawn across their throats,” he wrote.Mr. Sitton would sometimes report what he observed and interpret it plainly without qualifiers or the filter of a quoted voice. In Oxford in 1963, he wrote, “Racists here, as elsewhere, have underscored this principle: The rights of dissent and freedom of association — which they so frequently invoke for themselves — do not extend to those who disagree with them.”He could be evocative in his writing, as he was in a dispatch from 1963, datelined Greenwood, Miss.“The night of Feb. 28 was mild with a hint of early spring as the black sedan rolled westward along U.S. Route 82 across the Mississippi Delta,” he began.“One of its three Negro occupants recalled later that as a string of traffic faded to the rear near Itta Bena, a car that had trailed them from Greenwood pulled alongside. Two white men sat in front, one in back.“Bursts of gunfire rang out. Thirteen .45 caliber bullets stitched a ragged seam of finger-sized holes along the sedan’s left side and a copper-jacketed slug burned into the driver’s shoulder to within an inch of his spine.”In the so-called Freedom Summer of 1964, hundreds of college students from around the country went to Mississippi to register blacks to vote. On the night of June 21, 1964, three volunteers — Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman — were stopped by the police near Philadelphia, Miss., taken to jail and released. Then they disappeared. Forty-four days passed before their bodies were found in the mud of an earthen dam. All three had been shot to death. Mr. Sitton wrote 13 articles about the search for the bodies and their discovery.Describing the coverage of Freedom Summer, Newsweek magazine said: “One reporter stood above the rest. The best daily newspaperman on the Southern scene is the Atlanta-based Sitton.”Claude Fox Sitton was born in Atlanta on Dec. 4, 1925, one of two sons of Claude and Pauline Sitton. His great-grandfather had been a tax collector for the Confederacy, a slave owner and mayor of Pendleton, N.C. His father was a railroad conductor who bought a farm during the Depression, outside of Conyers, Ga. Young Claude worked beside black sharecroppers there.After graduating from high school in 1943, he joined the Navy and served in the Pacific. Home from the war, he earned a bachelor’s degree from Emory University in Atlanta in 1949 and worked for the International News Service and United Press.In 1953, he married Eva Whetstone, who survives him. Besides his son Clint, he is also survived by two daughters, Lea Stanley and Suzanna Greene; another son, Mac; and nine grandchildren.Mr. Sitton left journalism in 1955 to become a press attaché for the United States Information Agency in Ghana. But two years later he was hired by The Times as a copy editor. After nine months on the copy desk, he was asked by Mr. Catledge to return to the South.He came back to New York in the fall of 1964, after Freedom Summer, having been named national editor of The Times. He soon instituted a rule that a staff reporter must cover Dr. King wherever he went. Earl Caldwell, a Times correspondent, was in Memphis on April 4, 1968, when Dr. King was assassinated.Several weeks later, Mr. Sitton left The Times to become editor of The News & Observer, a post that he held until 1990. For many years, while editor, he wrote a Sunday column in which he continued to focus on civil rights but also on other topics, like the environment and public education. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1983. He also received a 1991 George Polk Award for career achievement.That he returned to the South after his years with The Times did not surprise his colleagues. He had never lost his emotional bond with the South, nor his drawl, for that matter. And for a reporter covering the region for a Northern newspaper, a drawl could come in handy.Roy Reed, a Times reporter hired by Mr. Sitton in 1965 to help cover the South, told how Mr. Sitton was once confronted by a group of menacing young men in Philadelphia, Miss.“One of these young toughs said, ‘Who are you?’ ” Mr. Reed said in an interview. “And Claude, in his thick South Georgia accent, responded, ‘I’m with The New York Times.’ ”“These guys thought this was patently ridiculous,” Mr. Reed said. “They laughed and walked away.”Correction: March 14, 2015An obituary on Wednesday about the journalist Claude Sitton misidentified his birthplace in Georgia. He was born in Atlanta, not Emory."
41,Meg Greenfield,editorial page editor,The Washington Post,"[1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995]",,"Post Editor, Newsweek Columnist Meg Greenfield DiesBy J.Y. SmithSpecial to The Washington PostFriday, May 14, 1999; Page A1Meg Greenfield, 68, the Pulitzer Prize-winning editor of the editorial page of The Washington Post and a columnist for Newsweek magazine, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Washington.An astute and principled observer, Greenfield spent her professional life writing about the events that shaped the second half of the 20th century. She brought to the task a rigorous intellect, a broad insight into the human condition and a conviction that life is not as simple as one would like. She distrusted shortcuts and the idea that it is always possible to reconcile differing points of view. In her world, there were losers as well as winners.Most of all, Greenfield loved irony -- the disjunction between reality and appearance in this or that bit of the day's news. Nothing pleased her more than pointing out the difference between what actually happened or was proposed in a given situation and the spin with which one interested party or another might describe it. She conveyed her findings to readers with gusto and a fine eye for detail and character.For more than 30 years, Greenfield helped shape The Post's views on issues ranging from war and peace to home rule for the District of Columbia and the proclivity of some drivers to run red lights. Katharine Graham, a former chairman of the board of The Washington Post Co. and one of Greenfield's closest friends, described her as ""independent and uninfluenced by trends or molds. Her judgment is very dispassionate.""Topics that particularly interested Greenfield included nuclear strategy, military preparedness, politics and civil rights.In a statement issued at the White House, President Clinton said, ""Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of"" her death. ""In her work for The Washington Post and Newsweek,"" the president said, ""Meg perfected the art of the newspaper column. Her essays were invariably tightly reasoned, forcefully stated and deeply felt. She called on those who work in government to pursue far-sighted public policy and bipartisan solutions. Her voice of eloquence and reason will be sorely missed.""Although she played one of the defining roles in the Washington drama in which the protagonists are the government and the media, Greenfield was an intensely private person. She avoided the television appearances and interviews by which many of her colleagues were known and limited herself to perhaps three appearances a year, usually in university settings. She disliked talking about herself and believed her job was to understand and record the news, not make it.A Perfectionist EditorGreenfield joined The Post as an editorial writer in 1968 and was named deputy editor of the editorial page in 1969. In 1978, she won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing for pieces about international affairs, civil rights and the press. She became editor of the editorial page in 1979.In 1974, she began a biweekly column in Newsweek, which is owned by The Washington Post Co. It dealt primarily with Washington life, a subject that, ""contrary to widespread belief,"" she explained, ""does not exclude everything human.""Her work was full of the context and underlying texture of events. She was interested in precedent as well as where an issue would go next. She had a knack for finding the nub of complicated situations. She loved argument and continued a tradition under which Post editorials avoided hortatory calls to action in favor of making points by marshaling facts.The Post's editorial board represents the publisher, Donald E. Graham, in matters of opinion. It is entirely separate from the news department, whose function is reporting on events rather than commenting on them. In practice, the distinction is sometimes blurred, but The Post's view is that readers should be able to tell at a glance whether they are reading fact or opinion. To this end, the news and editorial staffs at the newspaper are organized into entirely separate hierarchies. Greenfield dominated the editorial function in the same way that Leonard Downie Jr., the executive editor, or Benjamin C. Bradlee, his predecessor, have dominated the news side.She described the editorial board as a collective tending to middle age and having ""the sensibility of 1950s liberals."" By that, she meant it was generally conservative on foreign policy and national defense and generally liberal on social issues. She noted that liberals frequently said the paper was too conservative while conservatives at one time called it an arm of the Communist Party.One of Greenfield's most important tasks took place entirely out of public view. This was presiding over the daily meeting at which the next day's editorials are thrashed out. A small but commanding figure (she was 5-foot-1) at the head of a long table, she was gracious, witty, skeptical and given to the Socratic model of analysis by question. Although she said the process was give-and-take among ""intelligent and forgiving friends,"" it was not really democratic.She always had the final word.""People ask questions that tell me they presume something much more exotic, and often sinister, than it is,"" she told an interviewer. ""I don't think it's sinister at all. We try to keep -- without much success -- a certain amount of discretion, because . . . I don't know, Washington being Washington . . . you hear, 'Well, they said this, but the only reason they said this was that she hates that one and the other hates this, and this one lost the argument and the other one wept,' and so on. And all this stuff is almost invariably completely wrong.""The board's decisions were confidential and sometimes, as in the case of endorsing presidential or other political candidates, were guarded with great care until they were published.Besides editorials, Greenfield was responsible for the letters to the editor; the op-ed page; the ""Free for All"" page on Saturdays, which carries letters from readers; and the ""Close to Home"" page on Sundays, which carries longer local pieces by readers.As her staff could attest, she was a perfectionist and a ferociously hard worker. Nothing got on her pages without her approval. When she traveled, she would have material faxed or read to her over the telephone. She once called in changes from Saudi Arabia. The only exception to her sway was Herblock, the cartoonist, who is regarded at The Post as a kind of force of nature. He reports to no one.Greenfield was always on the lookout for interesting new writers. Among those she brought to the op-ed page were the columnists George Will, whom she encouraged to abandon academia for a career in journalism, and Charles Krauthammer, a psychiatrist turned commentator.Will recalled in a column how he had once telephoned Greenfield to say he couldn't get to the matters of state he usually wrote about because he had to baby-sit. She told him to write about what it was like to stay home from work and care for a child. The resulting piece drew a wide response from readers.The Power of the PenAlthough the influence of Post editorials is hard to gauge at any given time, it has been a factor in some local elections. Local politics also illustrate the editorial board's willingness to change its mind about candidates and issues.In 1978, for example, The Post backed Marion Barry, a council member and former civil rights leader, for mayor over the incumbent, Walter E. Washington, who had previously had the paper's support. The endorsement followed meetings between the editorial board and each candidate and a review of records, positions, qualifications and other material. Barry won handily.The Post also endorsed Barry in 1982 and 1986 with decreasing levels of enthusiasm. By 1988, the editorial page was deploring his ""propensity for scandal"" and ""huge capacity for self-indulgence,"" characteristics which it said tarnished ""the accomplishments of those serious government workers and political appointees who have labored to make the city work.""In 1990, Barry was convicted of a misdemeanor drug violation and sentenced to six months in federal prison. In that year, The Post gave its mayoral endorsement to Sharon Pratt Dixon (she later became Sharon Pratt Kelly), a power company executive who was a newcomer to politics, and she won. Four years later, the paper backed Carol Schwartz, a Republican, in the mayor's race. She lost to Barry, who returned to the mayor's office that year. Barry had been elected to the D.C. Council in 1992.Greenfield described the extent of The Post's influence in these terms:""What we tend to notice here is the great number of wise suggestions we make that are rejected at the polls, and in the agencies, and in the U.S. Congress, and in the District school board, and if there's someplace I've left out, remind me -- so that we don't feel the Republic or the environs are in any terrific danger of being [controlled] by the Washington Post editorial page. Much as we try.""On the other hand, she said, ""this is a town where people like to say to you, 'I never read editorials,' and then complain in minute detail about one that was in yesterday. This is a town where opinions are in conflict, at war in various ways.""The hazard of editorial writing, she once wrote, is complacency.""There is a little Mussolini in every editorial writer,"" she said. ""Pompous, meddlesome, pretentious, a figure of fun to everyone but himself . . . issuing grandiose orders that have no effect on anything at all . . . to which an ungrateful nation will reply, 'Oh, knock it off.' ""Early JournalismGreenfield was born in Seattle on Dec. 27, 1930. Her parents were Lewis James Greenfield and Lorraine Nathan Greenfield. Her father ran an antique furniture business. Her mother died when she was 12. She majored in English at Smith College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated summa cum laude in 1952. She then spent a year at Cambridge University studying the poetry of William Blake on a Fulbright Scholarship.In the 1956 presidential election, she was director of research for the New York committee of Adlai E. Stevenson, the Democratic candidate. The following year, she joined the Reporter, a magazine of political commentary. She was assigned to its Washington bureau in 1961, and in 1965 she was named Washington editor. She stayed in that job until the Reporter ceased publication in 1968 and The Post hired her.Making her way in a male-dominated industry was largely a matter of ""accidents and non-decisions,"" she said. She described herself as a wobbly spear-carrier in the feminist march. ""I was an English major who couldn't decide what to do,"" she told an interviewer. ""I wasn't trying to strike a blow for sisterhood."" Although she supported ""what's serious about the [feminist] movement,"" she resisted suggestions that there is a woman's perspective on general issues.""For example,"" she told Shop Talk, the Post employees' publication, ""the women in the House of Representatives reflect the whole political spectrum, and my own opinion is often at variance with the female politicians.""Greenfield was equally wary of political correctness. She detested the term ""Ms."" and preferred to be called Miss Greenfield. She once gave an address in Seattle decrying speech codes and calling on her audience to ""fight like tigers against government attempts to substitute its judgment for ours."" She added, however, that she regretted opposing efforts in Maryland to outlaw the word ""fatso."" (She worried about her weight.)Nothing disturbed her more than suggestions that The Post was open to the blandishments of Washington's vast and well-heeled public relations industry. In 1982, she sent a memo, which was later widely quoted outside The Post, to Bradlee, the executive editor, complaining that PR firms ""seem to be promising, among other promises, that they can get The Post to 'help' "" their clients.""The reason for saying no to these wolves is plain and very strong,"" she continued. ""Why should we be in their goddam memo traffic as exploitable or exploited 'resources'? Why should we be in their campaign plans as something 'deliverable' by their various agents who can 'reach' us?""Her solution was to proclaim what she called ""the irrational Greenfield rule."" This stated that the editorial staff would not accept any manuscript or interview request that came from a ""flack firm."" It proved unworkable and soon lapsed.Ethics and ResponsibilityOver the years, Greenfield frequently made working trips with Katharine Graham, and in the course of their travels, they had meetings with a number of world leaders. In 1988, with other Post and Newsweek staff members, Greenfield and Graham interviewed former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow.In 1986, Greenfield published a piece describing her observation that humdrum, ordinary life goes on even under extremely repressive regimes. ""You don't encounter absolute rule,"" she wrote, ""and it is the fault of a kind of Achtung delusion that you even expect it. For nobody and no group, not even the driven, arrogant Chinese government, can entirely control a nation's life.""Some of Greenfield's most powerful writing concerned ethics and how people respond to life's various imperatives. This was the subject of her first Newsweek column, which dealt with the disgrace of Spiro T. Agnew. The Maryland governor, he became vice president under Richard M. Nixon and a leading administration spokesman against all forms of wrongdoing. He resigned from office after an extensive federal investigation into allegations of bribery and extortion.The question Greenfield raised was whether he and his like ever were aware of their own duplicity and hypocrisy. ""Was it like being a double agent?"" she asked. ""Do you offer yourself a great crooked wink in the mirror every morning?""I think not. My speculation is that Mr. Agnew and the other lapsed preachers of our public life didn't make the connection -- didn't make the connection between their own crimes and those committed by other, 'lesser' people.""In a column in 1989, she wondered whether the decline of civility and the growing number of false and unproved accusations in politics weren't dulling the nation's ability to react to real scandal.""All day long around here, we . . . go around implying that the other fellow is lying, trimming, gouging, feathering his nest, murdering the innocent and otherwise violating everything that upright people hold dear. The effect of this constant play is that we lose the ability to recognize a genuine moral dereliction when we see one.""In a 1998 column, she wrote about public and private behavior and President Clinton's sexual relationship with a White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.""What is real,"" she said, ""and what we have been trying so hard to avoid all these months, is the one overarching question that we keep raising in our arguments and then fleeing because it is so complex and hard: What is the proper relationship of a public figure's personal behavior and private life to his conduct of public business?""It is a very large part of politics to try to get these relationships right, to rationalize them in a human and practical way to the extent we can -- to know where the lines should be drawn and to draw them. People say we should do this for our children. We should do this for ourselves, for our own self-respect.""At the very least, she said, Clinton should be forthright in taking responsibility for his actions.In private life, Greenfield had a wide acquaintance in Washington and elsewhere. She loved parties. She was responsible for introducing Warren E. Buffett, the noted investor, to Bill Gates, the founder and head of Microsoft Corp. Buffett was a guest at the house she built on Bainbridge Island near Seattle, and she took him to a party given by Gates's mother, an old friend.Greenfield described herself as a ""passionate, failed gardener."" She was a former volunteer at St. Ann's Infant Home in Hyattsville. She swam at Georgetown University and studied Latin for fun. Sometimes she and Katharine Graham would sneak out of the office and go to a movie.""I read, I fall asleep,"" she told the Washington Journalism Review. ""I realize as I read the newspaper that I lead a really dull life. I gotta tell you I just read in The Washingtonian about a book that's coming out that says Mamie Eisenhower and Buster Keaton were having an affair. These things always make me think, God, you know, I just thought everybody went home and read magazines.""Greenfield was a past co-chair of the Pulitzer Prize board, and she was a member of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. She held honorary degrees from Smith College, Williams College, Georgetown University, Wesleyan University and Princeton University.She leaves no immediate survivors.© Copyright 1999 The Washington Post Company"

Maynard, 56, Publisher Who Helped Minority JournalistsBy Bruce LambertAugust 19, 1993Robert C. Maynard, a trailblazer for minority journalists who was the first black editor and owner of a major daily newspaper in the United States, died at his home in Oakland, Calif., on Tuesday. He was 56.He died of prostate cancer, a family spokesman said.For a decade Mr. Maynard was the editor, publisher and owner of The Oakland Tribune, until eroding circulation and advertising forced its sale to the Alameda Newspaper Group last year.His newspaper career began to flourish when he became the White House correspondent for The Washington Post, and he eventually became an editor, national columnist, television panelist, Pulitzer Prize juror and a leader in professional organizations. Journalism's Jackie RobinsonBut he won more praise for his efforts to help minority youths follow him into journalism. Paul Cobb, who is active in Oakland community affairs, once said that ""Maynard is to publishing what Jackie Robinson is to baseball.""Mr. Maynard and his wife, the former Nancy Hicks, formed the Institute for Journalism Education at Berkeley, Calif., a nonprofit organization that trained hundreds of minority students. In management and professional circles, he advocated diversity and prodded news organizations to recruit and promote more minority employees.""This country cannot be the country we all want it to be if its story is told by only one group of citizens,"" he said in his last public speech, in May. ""Our goal is to give all Americans front-door access to the truth.""Mr. Maynard was a high school dropout, born to immigrant parents from Barbados in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. But he had his heart set on journalism as a youngster, even at the expense of his formal education. The allure of watching courtroom reporting led him to skip classes.While still a teen-ager he worked for The New York Age, a Brooklyn weekly. He also worked for The Afro-American News in Baltimore and The York Gazette and Daily in Pennsylvania, now The York Daily Record.After winning a Nieman fellowship at Harvard in 1966, Mr. Maynard joined The Post, where he won plaudits for his coverage of urban unrest. He served as a national correspondent, ombudsman and editorial writer before leaving The Post to found the training institute.Returning to newspapers, he was hired in 1979 as The Tribune's editor by its new owner, the Gannett chain. Despite Gannett's investments to improve the paper, it remained fiscally tenuous, based in a black community and competing with papers in affluent white suburbs and San Francisco.In 1983 Gannett sold The Tribune to Mr. Maynard for $22 million, financed by loans from Gannett and banks.Mr. Maynard's prominence grew when he became the paper's owner. He wrote a syndicated column, appeared as a commentator on the David Brinkley and MacNeil-Lehrer television programs and served on the boards of The Associated Press, the American Society of Newspaper Editors and the National News Council.Besides his wife, Mr. Maynard is survived by a daughter, Dori Maynard; two sons, David and Alex Maynard, and four brothers and sisters."

46,Howard Simons,curator,"Nieman Foundation, Harvard University","[1988, 1989]",,"(Courtesy of The New York Times)Howard Simons, Dies at Age 60, An Ex-Editor at Washington PostBy Alex S. JonesJune 14, 1989Howard Simons, a former managing editor of The Washington Post, died yesterday of pancreatic cancer in a hospice of Methodist Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. He was 60 years old and lived in Jacksonville Beach.Until recently, Mr. Simons had been curator of the Nieman Foundation, which sponsors a prestigious sabbatical program in which mid-career journalists are given a year of study at Harvard University.Mr. Simons was known as a journalistic traditionalist who prized aggressive reporting and was outspokenly critical of what he considered to be a modern trend toward lighter, less serious newspapers and an undue dependence on anonymous sources.''He played a vital role in everything that the paper did,'' Benjamin C. Bradlee, executive editor of The Post, said in an interview yesterday. ''He was a powerhouse here, and a mensch.''As managing editor of The Post, Mr. Simons helped direct the paper's investigation of the 1972 Watergate burglary that eventually led to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon two years later.''He got short-changed by the movie,'' Mr. Bradlee said, referring to the film ''All the President's Men,'' noting that Mr. Simons ''led the charge'' on Watergate.Mr. Simons's journalistic hallmark was an energetic aggresiveness that he sometimes described as ''280 miles per hour going into first.'' In recent years, he often railed at what he considered to be a dearth of probing investigative reporting. ''How could Ollie North have gotten away with it for so long?'' he asked rhetorically in an interview a month ago. BrIn 1984, after 13 years as managing editor of The Post, Mr. Simons became curator of the Nieman Foundation. The appointment suited his custom of nurturing those who worked for him with a mixture of affection and hard-boiled hectoring.Mr. Simons had been a Nieman Fellow in the class of 1959, and as curator broadened the program's reach to include more journalists from parts of Africa and South America. He had also successfully led a fund-raising campaign that increased the foundation's endowment by over $1 million.In early April, Mr. Simons learned that he was terminally ill with pancreatic cancer and elected not to take any treatment, instead addressing his illness with the frankness and astringent wit that had been one of his signatures. He said he had bet his doctor that he had incurable liver cancer, and was angry at himself as a former science writer for the misdiagnosis. When asked what he was going to do in Florida, he would crack that he planned to sunbathe without sunscreen.Though clearly in a weakened state, he insisted on fulfilling his duties as host at ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the Nieman program.Late last month, he resigned as curator and went to Jacksonville Beach with Tod, his wife of 32 years, where he was able to indulge his passions for fishing and bird-watching. Mrs. Simons said yesterday that upon arriving in Florida he had plunged into collecting and categorizing seashells.''We have lost one of the great spirits and souls of American journalism,'' said Bill Kovach, who was named acting curator of the Nieman Foundation last month.Mr. Simons was a native of Albany, N.Y., and received a bachelor of arts degree from Union College in Schenectady in 1951 and a master's degree a year later from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.After service in the Korean War, he became a science reporter in Washington for several news organizations, and joined The Post as a science writer in 1961. He became assistant managing editor in 1966 and managing editor in 1971.Mr. Simons was the author of ''Jewish Times: Voices of the American Jewish Experience,'' published by Houghton-Mifflin in 1988, and ''Simons' List Book,'' published in 1977. He edited two books with Joseph A. Califano Jr., ''The Media and the Law'' and ''The Media and Business,'' and in 1986 wrote a spy novel with Haynes Johnson called ''The Landing.''Mrs. Simons said yesterday that there was as yet no plan to memorialize her husband. ''His memorial service was really the last two months,'' she said of the flood of letters, articles and visitors after Mr. Simons's illness became public.Mr. Simons is survived by his wife, the former Tod Katz, and four daughters: Anna, who returned from studies in Africa to be with her father; Isabel, who lives in Maryland; Julie, of Washington, and Rebecca, of New York City. He is also survived by a brother, Sanford Simons."

She writes that “Poetry is analytic as well as expressive; it distinguishes, reconstructs, and redescribes what it discovers about the inner life. The poet accomplishes the analytic work of poetry chiefly by formal means.”It is Vendler’s skills in unraveling the forms and explaining the heart of a poem that have made her one of the most influential voices in poetry criticism today. “She is like a receiving station picking up on each poem, unscrambling things out of word-waves, making sense of it and making sure of it. She can second-guess the sixth sense of the poem,” says poet Seamus Heaney.Vendler’s influences include a Boston childhood immersed in poetry and hymns, an early interest in chemistry, and a wealth of wonderful teachers. Her own teaching career has spanned forty-four years and she is now the A. Kingsley Porter University Professor at Harvard University, where she received her Ph.D. in English and American literature in 1960. She previously taught at Cornell, Swarthmore, Haverford, Smith, and Boston University. She has held many fellowships, including three NEH fellowships and a Fulbright, and has frequently been a judge for the Pulitzer Prize in poetry. She holds twenty-three honorary degrees from universities and colleges in the United States and abroad.Vendler’s views on contemporary poetry can be read regularly in the pages of The New Republic, The London Review of Books, The New Yorker, and other journals.Her recent books include Coming of Age as a Poet: Milton, Keats, Eliot, Plath; Seamus Heaney; The Art of Shakespeare’s Sonnets; The Breaking of Style: Hopkins, Heaney, Graham; The Given and the Made: Lowell, Berryman, Dove, Graham, and Soul Says: On Recent Poetry. A forthcoming book, Poets Thinking: Pope, Whitman, Dickinson, Yeats, will be published later this year.Vendler lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and has one son and two grandchildren."

Mellon Foundation have elected Elizabeth Alexander to be the Foundation’s next President, effective March 2018. Alexander will succeed Earl Lewis, who has served as President since 2013.Alexander, a renowned writer, poet, and scholar, is recognized as one of the nation’s leading voices in modern literature and a bold visionary in the academy. Over the course of a distinguished academic and artistic career, she has developed a number of complex, multi-arts and multi-disciplinary teams, departments and partnerships, and dedicated herself consistently to creating, building and sustaining highly successful institutions – from the Poetry Center at Smith College, to a major rebuilding of the African American Studies department at Yale University, from the poetry non-profit Cave Canem, to the Ford Foundation’s programs in journalism, arts and culture.  “The Mellon Foundation is dedicated to the enrichment of the arts and humanities, both inside and outside of colleges and universities; these practice areas are fundamental to strengthening not only our learning institutions, but also the human spirit,” said Danielle Allen, Chair of the Mellon Foundation Board. “Through her work as a professor and mentor, Elizabeth knows the academic system well, and as an architect of interdisciplinary programs, she has deep experience in cultivating partnerships that extend and amplify creative vision. A poet who brings an artist’s forward-looking energy to institutional purpose, Elizabeth is the right person for our times as the Foundation seeks to widen the community of stakeholders committed to the arts and humanities and to increase the resources dedicated to this work.”  The Mellon Foundation, the nation’s most generous and active supporter of the humanities, is committed to five core program areas: higher education and scholarship in the humanities; arts and cultural heritage; diversity; scholarly communications; and international higher education and strategic projects. The Foundation believes that the health of arts and humanities is critical to the success of higher education, to the human spirit and societal well-being, and to civic preparation. The Foundation seeks to broaden the role the humanities play in education, innovation, and civic discourse, by providing grants and strategic guidance to support educational and cultural institutions, research, and public humanities engagements.“I have lived my entire life with art, culture, and scholarship as companion, guide, and discipline,” said Alexander. “I am guided by the justice values of increasing access to the power of higher education to open and strengthen minds, encourage human exchange, and thus transform lives. I am deeply honored to have been selected to lead Mellon, an institution that has been devoted to these areas across its history, and to have been called to the crucial work of building community within and across discipline and institution. The humanities show us deeply who we are and what it means to move through life by the light of cultural vision. I am excited for the work ahead of elevating the truth, beauty and rigor of the arts and higher learning and making them more accessible to all.”Most recently, Alexander served as the Wun Tsun Tam Mellon Professor in the Humanities in the Department of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University. Prior to assuming her position, she served as the Director of Creativity and Free Expression at the Ford Foundation.While at the Ford Foundation, Alexander co-designed the Art for Justice Fund, a $100 million fund seeded by philanthropist Agnes Gund to transform the criminal justice system and all of its inequities through art and advocacy.“Elizabeth is one of the brightest lights in the academy and a remarkable artist.  She made an invaluable contribution to the arts program at Ford and I’m confident that she will be a great leader of the Mellon Foundation,” said Darren Walker, President of the Ford Foundation.Alexander spent 15 years on the faculty of Yale University, beginning in 2000. She was appointed the inaugural Frederick Iseman Professor of Poetry in 2015, and served as the Thomas E. Donnelly Professor of African American Studies and as the Chair of the African American Studies Department. Prior to those appointments, she was a professor in the departments of African American Studies, American Studies and English. She served as the inaugural Director of the Poetry Center at Smith College, and taught for seven years at the University of Chicago, where she won the Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching. She also taught at New York University’s Graduate Creative Writing Program.“The unique qualities that make Elizabeth Alexander the creative and intellectual force we have been so proud to welcome to Columbia will undoubtedly serve her well in her new leadership role at the Mellon Foundation,” said Columbia President Lee C. Bollinger.  “While our university community will miss the first-hand benefit of her relentless commitment to conveying and improving the human condition, we are delighted by her ascent in the philanthropic world and look forward to working with her in her new mission of scholarship and service.”“She will be a passionate spokesperson for the ideas of Mellon and the humanities and the arts; this is what she does every day. She is visionary. She has the ability to embody and communicate the value of liberal education, the humanities and arts, access, diversity, and to do it with poetry,” said Peter Salovey, President of Yale University.Said outgoing Mellon Foundation President Earl Lewis, who is returning to the academy, and launching a new initiative, The Center for Social Solutions, to focus efforts on three core areas of concern – race and diversity, water, and the future of work, “Elizabeth is a highly regarded academic thought leader and proven philanthropist; she is also someone I admire deeply.  I wish her well as she assumes her new role as President of The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Her appointment comes at a time when the work of advancing the fundamentals of a prosperous democracy needs forward-looking leaders.”Lewis delivered the Foundation’s first ever strategic plan and brought grant-making program areas into closer collaboration. Under his leadership, the Foundation brought new institutions into the fold and developed a broader network of partners across the many sectors of the higher education landscape. Lewis also launched significant Presidential initiatives including the Mellon Research Forum and the Our Compelling Interests book series focused on diversity and social connectedness.In her new role, Alexander will lead the Mellon Foundation in drawing new partners in to support the arts and humanities and in refining the Foundation’s distinctive blend of a commitment to the arts and humanities for social purposes and for their own sake. She expects to build on the Foundation’s success to date in supporting diversification of educational, scholarly, and cultural organizations with an innovative focus on cultivating institutional capacity for inclusive leadership; and she seeks to widen and deepen the impact of the Foundation’s support for a vision of an inclusive America. Linking the Foundation’s international work to its core strategic priorities will also be an important objective.Alexander is the author of the New York Times bestseller The Light of the World, a memoir on love and loss, which was a finalist in 2016 for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. She is also the author of six books of poetry, including American Sublime, a finalist for the 2005 Pulitzer Prize, and two collections of essays – The Black Interior and Power and Possibility.  In 2009, Alexander wrote and recited an original poem, “Praise Song for the Day,” at the inauguration of President Barack Obama, becoming the fourth-ever poet to read at a presidential inauguration.Additional works include: Praise Song for the Day; Crave Radiance: New and Selected Poems 1990-2010, winner of the Patterson Prize for Poetry and a nominee of the Hurston-Wright Foundation Award for Poetry; The Black Interior, a finalist for Best Non-Fiction, Hurston-Wright Foundation; and Body of Life.

Her extraordinary poems move across the registers from ode to elegy in contemplation of the many rich layers of African American history, and its many vital forms of community. Having been moved and consoled by her work as an artist, I am thrilled to see what her talents will bring about in her new role at the Mellon Foundation,” said Tracy K. Smith, U.S. Poet Laureate. Alexander received her Ph.D. in English from the University of Pennsylvania.
